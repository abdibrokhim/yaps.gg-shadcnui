# 778 Foundation Startup Application: Fuel Your Venture

## What would you like us to know about your identity?

I want to share my one-year story; from February 2023 to February 2024. I will try to keep it short and fun (hopefully). Sit back, relax, and enjoy!

I was studying at University, but I really wanted to earn some cash, haha, you heard it correctly, I needed some cash. However, I did prefer not physically, but online through my knowledge. After some research, and browsing the internet, I found a website where everyone could participate and win cash as a prize. I liked it, so I registered for upcoming hackathons.

Two hackathons passed, then I received a life-changing invitation (I did not know that time it would be life-changing) from a Chinese director and engineer to join a diverse team of senior engineers, developers, founders, and business leaders (we were 6 in a team) for the upcoming hackathon. This experience was eye-opening. The knowledge and insights I gained were priceless. I continued to immerse myself in hackathons, supporting beginners and collaborating with upcoming interns at Microsoft and Amazon, which further expanded my professional network.

Later, I got an offer from an Algerian senior engineer, and worked with him on a startup as Flutter Developer. Actually, I had zero knowledge in Flutter, but he said; "I give you time and mentor you, so you learn it". That was crazy! I worked with him for roughly 9 months, and learned to build real-world scalable full-stack applications. I also wrote a research paper in machine learning with my Professor, and tried mentoring and writing AI tutorials for AI communities with over 100,000 builders. Throughout my time at hackathons, startups, and writing tutorials, I was skilled in different programming languages, frameworks, tools, and concepts.

Furthermore, after AI became hyped all around the world, I attempted to start a company using ChatGPT as an experiment (it worked out). Then, I applied for Microsoft for Startups Founders Hub and got accepted. Later, I created a YouTube channel to share my knowledge, but I keep tutorials fun. I\'m also active on LinkedIn (I have 3 badges, haha).

At present I'm a Junior student at university. I'm learning leadership skills at Nobel. Working on startups. And mentoring.


## What was the moment in your life when you knew you wanted to do something to help fix the planet?

I have always wanted to help not only fix the planet, but also people with disabilities or illnesses. But why? Because I am human, and I should always support others, and be responsible for our planet. Yeah, it may sound weird, but it makes sense. As a result, I am working on solutions for hospitals and clinics, and with passion fostering a supportive community among healthcare professionals and patients. Moreover, I have been accepted into Microsoft for Startups Founders hub, and now I can fully optimize my solutions with premium services.


## Without sharing your resume tell us your experience and why you are dedicated to leaving school/your current job to work on this project?

Without sharing your resume tell us your experience and why you are dedicated to leaving school/your current job to work on this project?

I do not have solid knowledge in Algorithms & Data Structures, but my curiosity and resilience always pushes me to move forward and try out new technologies and tools. My journey over the past year has been full of learning, growth, and exploration. I've participated in tons of hackathons, and been part of different startups. I've had the privilege of working with diverse teams including, senior engineers and directors, founders and business leaders, and contributing to impactful projects along with them.
My mission is to improve healthcare. My vision is to foster a supportive community among healthcare professionals and patients. Old healthcare solutions are already dead, we need community powered, collaboration oriented, and engaging platform. Lemme shape the future healthcare instead of sitting in a classroom.


## And finally, tell us your idea for combating climate change and how you\'re actively working towards it.

My idea for combating climate change is really simple but yet powerful. By leveraging technology to promote sustainable practices in healthcare, I aim to reduce the carbon footprint of hospitals and clinics by digitizing medical records, processes and *everything in the upcoming future. I can significantly decrease the amount of paper waste and energy consumption in healthcare facilities, replacing paper-based systems to digital platforms
I'm actively working towards this goal by collaborating with hospitals to implement solutions, continuously refining AI models to enhance efficiency, and promoting awareness about the environmental impact of healthcare operations.
