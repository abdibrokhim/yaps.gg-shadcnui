# ADVENTURE X 2025, WAS IT FAIR?

> going thro my application

## Please describe the skills or abilities you have or are currently learning.
I’ve diverse skills, including frontend, backend, API integration, automation, 3d modeling, graphic design, music production, content creation and many more. I just love creating stuff and building things. I’m curious about whatever.

I’ve participated in over 70+ hackathons. I’ve solid experience on tools and technologies, what to use and how to use properly. Just hackathons shaped me really well. I use React, NextJS, TailwindCSS, ShadcnUI, Framer motion to built cool UI/UX. For the backend, I mostly use NextJS app router. Supabase, Neon for DB. But it depends, I’ve also projects with Rust, ActixWeb, and Shuttle on the backend. And sometimes Python with FastAPI, Flask, Django (rare). For automations I go with Zapier, Python, and Javascript. Since I’ve experience with creative stuff (as I mentioned earlier), all the models, characters, logos, animations, or whatever solely made by me. You can them on presentation slides, websites, apps, etc. Also, I create music, sound effects myself.

## Why do you want to attend AdventureX 2025?
I just love hackathons. Why? Because during hackathon I’ve (teams) have limited time to ship the stuff. Crazy part is, you don’t even want to sleep, lol. You just supply with few cool drinks and cracked team, build stuff.

I believe AdventureX will be something even bigger than hackathon. I’ve never been in China, so it’s kinda unique opportunity to visit China and talk to cracked students.

I can’t imagine the level of networking that will be there during hackathon. Whoa! I’m super EXCITED!!

I think, i will stay overnight. It’s will be an experiment for me to try out tents and sleeeping bags for the first time. I dunno how it feels, lol. Yo, snacks, soda, coffee yet cool!

I’ve also deep interest in Robotics, AR/VR things. So, I will definitely try out Hardware Labs and sessions.

So, basically. I would love to attend and be part of AdventureX 2025 Hackathon. Great chance to learn from each other and exchange ideas. Cracked!!

In short:

Have fun. Build stuff. Go unicorn wild.

Please tell us your expectations for AdventureX 2025
I believe AdventureX will be super unique hackathon experience in my life compare to past 70+ hackathons that were held online (90% percent). I respect in-person events.

it will be funny. it will be super crazy.

let’s make something cool.

## If you are working on a collaborative project, what kind of personality would you find hard to team up with?
From my own experience (e.g., after participating in over 70+ hackathons) I would say, I work best with clear talk, shared ownership, and a growth mindset. If a teammate bocks information, focuses on flaws, or grabs every decision, the project stalls and the team feels small. I prefer partners who trade ideas freely, lift each other, and trust the group to get the things done.

## Without any magical powers, how can you move a mountain in real life?
easy-peasy, just convince a cartographer to redraw the map. Mountain’s new address: “over there.”

## Do you think you are lucky? If so, why? If not, do you think it’s unfair?
I don’t think it’s about luck. It’s about hard work and consistency. Still, life isn’t always fair, it keeps pressure on us to make us stronger and ready for future, more complex challenges. And that’s okay. But sometimes I feel really bad and just hate it. Just yesterday, I even wrote a comprehensive article about my tough experiences at hackathons (https://medium.com/@abdibrokhim/i-hate-hackathons-heres-why-7e0f2537344e).

So, I don’t think I’m lucky, but I believe I’m strong enough to keep trying.
