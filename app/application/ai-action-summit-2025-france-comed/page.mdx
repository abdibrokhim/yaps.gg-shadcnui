## Project Summary: CoMed—Reshaping Brain MRI Diagnostics with AI

Overview CoMed is an innovative AI-powered platform designed to transform Brain MRI diagnostics, making them easier, faster, and more accessible, especially for underserved populations in rural areas. By integrating advanced deep learning models into existing hospital workflows, CoMed enhances diagnostic accuracy from 84% to 95% and reduces waiting times from 3 days to just 15–30 minutes. Our mission is to reshape medical diagnostics through cutting-edge technology, ultimately improving patient outcomes and fostering a more interconnected global healthcare ecosystem.

Target Population and Their Situation Our primary focus is on hospitals, clinics, and specialized MRI centers in regions where access to advanced diagnostic equipment and expert radiologists is limited. In countries like Uzbekistan, only 15% of hospitals have MRI machines, and 85% of deaths are due to non-communicable diseases. Rural areas suffer from a dire shortage of medical professionals and equipment, leading to delayed or inaccurate diagnoses due to excessive bureaucracy and reliance on overburdened human resources.

Desired Impact CoMed aims to bridge the healthcare gap between urban centers and rural communities by:

- Improving Accessibility: Providing affordable AI-powered diagnostic tools that require minimal additional infrastructure.
- Enhancing Accuracy: Elevating diagnostic precision to 95%, thereby reducing misdiagnoses and improving patient outcomes.
- Reducing Wait Times: Cutting diagnostic turnaround from days to minutes, which is critical in time-sensitive medical situations.
- Facilitating Remote Consultations: Enabling fully remote consultations through our integrated mobile app, allowing specialists to reach patients regardless of location.
- Long-Term Objectives Our long-term vision is to make advanced medical diagnostics universally accessible. We strive to create a supportive and interconnected healthcare ecosystem that empowers both professionals and patients. By fostering global collaboration and embracing a patient-centric approach, we aim to contribute to a healthier world where quality healthcare is not limited by geography.
