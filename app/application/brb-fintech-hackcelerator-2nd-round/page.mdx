## Расскажите о прошлом опыте участия на хакатонах  |
Hakatonlarda ishtirok etish bo'yicha oldingi tajribangiz haqida so'zlab bering | Tell us about your past experience participating in hackathons

Over the last year we participated in many hackathons. We always focus on making something people want. For example: 1) Report Cruncher. It is a financial analysis platform designed to simplify financial reports for retail investors using advanced machine learning. Leveraging the GPT-3 Curie model fine-tuned with the ECTSum dataset, it provides easy-to-understand financial insights, empowering retail investors to make informed decisions. 2) In the last hackathon, we faced some issues while working with Langflow. As a beginner to this platform, we struggled to determine which components connect to which edges and had some issues with the drag-and-drop functionality. Then we thought, what if we automate the whole process using AI? It would be an AI-powered AI, haha. So, we integrated voice input into Langflow. We used OpenAI’s Whisper API for transcriptions and GPT-4o for understanding human instructions and generating JSON nodes. It worked! We came up with a cool one-liner for our project description: “We automated Langflow with AI. No more drag and drop; simply dictate, and AI gets the work done!” It sounds so promising. As I (leader of the team) write this, we have already received five stars in all four categories. It’s so cool! Compared to traditional drag-and-drop methods, we even saved 4 seconds when building a simple chatbot. 3) We also collaborated on a Mental-Wellness hackathon. We built MeWellAI, an AI-powered mobile app for Mental Wellness. It’s like a social media app. There are specific Agents for specific Mental illnesses. It's a kind of agentic app. In the future AI will decide what to post (i mean create post and share autonomously), and create different courses and training tailored to specific users.

## Как вы планируете организовать каталог бизнесов на вашей платформе? Опишите, какие функции и фильтры будут доступны пользователям. | Platformangizda biznes katalogini qanday tashkil qilmoqchisiz? Foydalanuvchilarga qanday funksiyalar va filtrlash imkoniyatlari mavjud bo'ladi? | How do you plan to organize the business catalog on your platform? Describe the features and filters that will be available to users.


Our plans for the very first version of the platform.

We will consider implementing a well-organized category system that encompasses various sectors, including social impact, creative projects, business and innovation, and personal needs. This structure will allow us to effectively showcase a wide range of projects while maintaining a clear and intuitive navigation system for our users.

We are going to implement predefined categories such as Healthcare, Education, Environment, and Community Projects under the Social Impact section, while also including Creative Projects categories like Music, Film, and Art. To cater to the business community, we'll have dedicated sections for Startups, Small Business Growth, and Technology Development. Additionally, we understand the importance of personal fundraising, so we'll include categories for Travel, Education, and Emergency Needs.

To enhance the user experience and improve project discoverability, we're going to introduce user-generated tags. This feature will allow project creators to add specific tags that further define their initiatives, such as "uzbek music" or "school renovation." By doing so, we'll provide users with more precise search options and help them find projects that align closely with their interests.

We will focus on creating comprehensive campaign profiles that include detailed project descriptions, engaging visual content, real-time funding progress updates, and a communication channel between creators and supporters. These profiles will serve as the cornerstone of our platform, providing potential donors with all the information they need to make informed decisions about supporting projects.

To make project discovery as seamless as possible, we're going to implement robust search and filtering options. This will include a powerful search bar with keyword functionality and multiple filtering criteria such as location, project type, funding amount needed, and project deadlines. We'll also allow users to sort projects based on popularity, progress, and featured status, ensuring that they can easily find projects that resonate with them.

Understanding the importance of localization, we will ensure that our platform's language, currency, and payment options are tailored specifically to the Uzbek market. We're going to integrate various payment methods, including popular Uzbek payment providers, to accommodate local preferences and make the donation process as smooth as possible.

To build trust and security on our platform, we will promote transparency by providing detailed project information and regular updates. We're also going to implement secure payment processing and design a user-friendly interface to instill confidence in our users.

As part of our growth strategy, we will consider partnering with Uzbek YouTubers, social media influencers, and potential project creators to promote our platform. We're also going to explore collaborations with local NGOs, community organizations, and government bodies to generate more projects and increase our platform's visibility.

By implementing these features and strategies, we are confident that we can create a user journey that is intuitive and engaging. For example, a user looking for an education project in Tashkent will be able to easily navigate to the Education category, filter by Tashkent location, and sort by popularity or urgency to find relevant projects quickly.


Our plans for Phase Two enhancements. 


We are going to introduce robust social sharing options, allowing our users to easily promote campaigns via various channels. This will significantly increase the visibility and reach of campaigns, encouraging more donations through user networks. Additionally, we'll implement real-time goal progress visualization, providing motivation for donors by showing how close each campaign is to reaching its target.

To enhance user experience further, we're going to utilize advanced data science libraries to deliver comprehensive and clear visualizations. These will include line graphs, bar charts, pie charts, and custom charts, providing detailed insights into campaign progress and donor trends. This will make it easier for our users to analyze and strategize their campaigns effectively.

We will integrate an advanced AI "CrowdChat" feature, utilizing technologies like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). This chat-based interaction will allow users to ask questions and get answers without navigating through filters, simplifying user interaction and enhancing accessibility. Furthermore, we're excited to introduce "CrowdAgent", an AI-powered tool that will help users create their crowdfunding pages, including generating corresponding images and content. This will streamline the campaign creation process, making it more accessible and less time-consuming for all our users.

Understanding the importance of global reach, we are going to integrate a wide range of international payment providers, including PayPal, Stripe, Apple Pay, and Google Pay. This expansion will allow our campaigns to reach international supporters and increase funding opportunities for our users.

We will implement a newer, updated user interface that navigates users through the platform more effectively. This enhancement aims to improve the user journey, making our platform more intuitive and engaging, which we believe will lead to higher user satisfaction and retention.

To provide even more value to our users, we're going to integrate with foreign crowdfunding platforms, allowing easy duplication of crowdfunding pages. This feature will increase campaign visibility and potential funding by leveraging multiple platforms, thereby expanding reach for our users' projects.




## Какие технологии вы будете использовать для обработки и безопасной передачи платежей? | To'lovlarni qayta ishlash va xavfsiz uzatish uchun qanday texnologiyalardan foydalanmoqchisiz? | What technologies will you use for processing and securely transmitting payments?


We are going to focus on integrating widely used local payment gateways such as Payme and Click to ensure familiarity and trust among our Uzbek users. Additionally, we'll incorporate global payment options like PayPal and Stripe to expand our potential funding pool and attract international contributors. To cater to the growing mobile user base, we're planning to integrate Apple Pay and Google Pay for convenient mobile transactions.

Understanding the importance of traditional banking methods, we will offer direct transfers to Uzbek bank accounts, with a particular focus on popular institutions like Ipak Yo'li Bank and Ipoteka Bank. This will provide our users with a full range of payment options to suit their preferences.

We are considering using either Braintree or Adyen as our primary payment processing framework. These platforms offer comprehensive payment support, advanced security features, and detailed reporting capabilities, which will be crucial for our business operations and decision-making processes.






## Опишите, как вы будете обеспечивать безопасность данных пользователей и их инвестиций на платформе | Platformada foydalanuvchi ma'lumotlari va ularning investitsiyalari xavfsizligini qanday ta'minlaysiz? | Describe how you will ensure the security of user data and their investments on the platform.


Security is paramount in our payment strategy. We will implement SSL/TLS encryption to secure all data transfers, ensure PCI DSS compliance for handling payment data, and utilize tokenization to protect sensitive user information. We're also going to employ end-to-end encryption and use AES encryption for stored payment data. To combat fraud, we'll deploy machine learning algorithms, implement 3D Secure protocols, and use two-factor authentication.

For seamless integration, we will utilize RESTful APIs provided by payment gateways and implement webhooks to receive real-time updates on transaction statuses. We're committed to regularly conducting security audits and vulnerability assessments to ensure compliance with all applicable regulations, including Uzbek financial regulations and data protection laws.

To maintain optimal performance, we're going to implement real-time monitoring tools such as AWS CloudWatch or the ELK stack. This will allow us to track payment processing performance and quickly identify any issues. We will also provide dedicated customer support to assist users with payment-related queries, ensuring a smooth experience for all our users.

...5th: Crowdfunding platform

in my opinion 5 is potential. because even now i need this kind of platform.

and many youtubers also do Crowdfunding, to support hospitals, schools, or whatever

let's imagine i won ticket to go conference, but i have a little money to pay fee. so, i could use crowdfunding platform to collect money.

i mean we can focus on Uzbekistan market. 

there are a lot youtubers now, they leave their credit cards in the description. instead they could use our crowdfunding platform. 

they can also create goals and separately paste the links, for example 1) for development of channel. 2) donate to hospital. 3) …
