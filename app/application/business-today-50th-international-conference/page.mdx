# Business Today\'s 50th International Conference: Global Insights

## Describe the world you come from (i.e. your country, your family, your community etc). How has that world shaped your dreams and aspirations? (250 words)

I was born in a village and grew up in a modern capital city. I love my country for its amazing culture and unique traditions. Here, people are so welcoming and respect each other as a whole family. 

I have a big family. My parents are the best in the world. They taught me how important family is to life and how to balance one's life. They provided me with the basics of ethics and a moral outlook on life and the world. My siblings are so kind. They taught me to find joy even in difficult times and to keep moving forward with optimism.

My community taught me that everyone is equal and there are few differences, other than some biological differences between females and males. It emphasized the importance of collaboration with different people from various backgrounds and nationalities. Being part of an online supportive community has shown me the value of connecting with others virtually. I learned resilience by facing failures and seizing every opportunity to try again. Working with Senior Engineers from big companies prepared me as a professional.

My university taught me how to acquire knowledge, communicate effectively, and collaborate in this fast-paced world. It guided me from childhood to adulthood. It provided opportunities to network, exchange ideas, and benefit from each other's experiences. It also showed me that we all have our unique strengths and weaknesses. But, by teaming up together, we can complement each other. 

I am what I am today due to my family, my community, and the education systems I attended.
