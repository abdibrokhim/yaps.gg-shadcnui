# Catalyst Program Application: Accelerate Your Growth

## One-liner:
A resilient and research-oriented student who embraces every opportunity, regardless of the outcome.

## Why do you want to join Catalyst's community?
I love building stuff that matters. Last year, I really enjoyed working with the CEO at startup Souk e-commerce company. Even we stopped it for a while since we could not find any investors. I understand how it looks to work at a startup, gained tons of knowledge, learned different tools/techs and became resilient. I want to join the Catalyst Community to be surrounded with a like-minded group of ambitious future leaders. I believe the community will give me a big opportunity from launching my own startup idea to become a unicorn company. Exchanging ideas, communicate with other fellow students will benefit my world outlook and wisdom. I saw that Catalyst is Top #1 community, and it is a big chance for me to feel the vibe and talk to students from Top ranked universities such as MIT, Harvard, and Princeton.

## What are you aiming towards? What is your definition of success?
I aim towards helping others to achieve their goals. I love talking to people, supporting and encouraging them. When I saw their success I felt proud that I could change their life, I could influence them and become part of their long and not easy journey. I would say success comes different and it's different for everyone. Personally, I do not care if I am successful or not, however I do care that my step and action could change one's entire life into something they did not even imagine. Everything should be with facts, so to be honest till writing this paragraph I helped one more girl to work on her idea and just try it out, no matter the outcome, each action matters.

## What problem are you most passionate about solving?
I am passionate about healthcare. I know that health is one of the number one things that drives every person. If you feel sick or have even a little headache sometimes you don't want to do anything except laying down and looking above. I want to create an interactive, secure, supportive platform that connects patients, doctors, and hospitals in a dynamic, interactive community. Where people can support each other in these bad health moments. Where professional medical doctors can talk with patients, encourage, and somehow motivate them to look at life from different perspectives. Where hospitals and clinics are part of an ecosystem that not only enhances the healthcare experience but also builds a bridge between healthcare professionals and patients. And this is just the beginning of our journey.

## Please attach a link to a 1-2 minute video introducing yourself and responding to this question: What is the most important lesson you've learned, and how did you learn it?
Hi, my name is Ibrohim Abdivokhidov. I'm a research-oriented student. Last year, I joined a startup company and worked with the CEO parallel. We worked day and night everyday with one mission to build an ecommerce mobile application for Algeria. It was hard, but fun also. We day-to-day searched for investors, and presented our solution in seek for funding. 9 months passed, but we could not attract even a tiny investment for our startup. We stopped for a while. I was sad. I was like, we did something, and had zero outcome. However, the CEO and my best friend told me; “at least we tried it out”. I became more resilient. No matter the outcome of this application, at least I tried it out. [catalyst_pitch.mp4]()
