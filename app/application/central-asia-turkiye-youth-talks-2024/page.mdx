# 2024 Central Asia & Türkiye Youth Talks: Join & Inspire


## Please describe how you contribute to the youth development and/or promotion of the role of youth in the decision-making processes in your communities.

Over seven months, I mentored five schoolgirls who were passionate about AI and IT. I broke down complex topics and high-level industry tools into simple explanations and supportive video materials. This approach helped them learn to manage and develop scalable applications. This mentorship gave them technical skills and boosted their confidence in contributing to the tech industry.

Later, I created a collaborative platform for tech enthusiasts to work together. We organized hackathons and open-source projects to encourage teamwork and knowledge sharing. By hosting sessions and discussions, I promoted community engagement and helped members team up for projects. The platform has grown to over 100 members, showing its success in empowering young tech enthusiasts to participate in community-building and innovation.

As a writer and technical mentor, I wrote tutorials on AI technologies and mentored over 10,000 teams, helping them refine AI ideas and prototypes. My guidance improved their technical skills and helped them achieve project goals. 

During my leadership internship at Nobel PBC, I taught an Introduction to Design course to over 20 new interns, preparing them for careers in UI/UX. I focused on providing fundamental design skills and fostering leadership qualities.

I also shared educational and motivational content about technology and personal development, which grew my social media presence significantly. This platform allows me to inspire young people to pursue careers in technology and innovation.

Furthermore, as an IT Volunteer in the IT Community of Uzbekistan, I contributed to local hackathons, promoting a culture of innovation and collaboration among young tech enthusiasts.


## Why do you want to take part in this event? (minimum 200 words)

I am passionate about healthcare. I know that health is one of the number one things that drives every person. If you feel sick or have even a little headache sometimes you don't want to do anything except laying down and looking above. 

So recently my Professor and I visited our government hospital in Tashkent. So there I found people are waiting in a big queue just to get the imaging results. So doctors are facing too much problem while giving the conclusion based on the results what they are getting based on the images. So this conclusion is taking a lot of time. So we plan like; why don't we build an Al machine which analyzes the results and it gives a conclusion automatically. 

I am applying to Central Asia and Türkiye Youth Talks because I am eager to join a community that is at the forefront of digitalization, social entrepreneurship and gender development. I believe that participating in this event presents the most effective way to explore new opportunities in which digital technologies can contribute to sustainable and resilient development and promote healthcare. Exchanging ideas, communicating with young people from different nationalities (e.g., Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, Türkiye, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan) will benefit my world outlook and wisdom. 


## What are your expectations of participation at this event? (minimum 200 words)

I believe the Central Asia and Türkiye Youth Talks will be incredible and remarkably different from any event I've attended before. I am especially excited that it will be held in Istanbul, the largest city in Türkiye, which is considered the country's economic, cultural, and historic capital. I am eager to travel, meet the people, and experience the culture, technology, and innovations there.

This event presents a huge opportunity to establish a strong network with 30 young people from Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, Türkiye, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. Staying overnight in such a dynamic environment, surrounded by like-minded young individuals, sharing meals, and experiencing the vibrant atmosphere will be an incredible way to immerse myself in the youth community and forge lasting connections. I look forward to engaging in meaningful discussions, workshops, and activities that will enhance my understanding and skills in social entrepreneurship and innovation.

Iterating over different ideas and exploring digitalization is something I always target. Collaboration is the key to changing lives and shaping the world. These 30 participants are not just a number; they are the selected individuals who strive to foster mutual learning and development in their communities. 

I'm confident that I will return to my home country with lifetime memories, invaluable experiences, and a renewed passion for making a positive impact.


## How are you going to use the knowledge and skills gained at the event in the future? (minimum 200 words)

Four may not seem like a big number. However, attending the Central Asia and Türkiye Youth Talks for four days is a perfect opportunity to gain hands-on knowledge and skills. Living and engaging with young people from Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, Türkiye, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan will teach me how to communicate effectively in a multinational community. Understanding their different perspectives will help improve my upcoming startups, ensuring the right technologies, tools, and user experiences are tailored to each country\'s culture.

I will apply the advice and leadership skills I gain to my Open Community startup, fostering a more inclusive and innovative environment. Additionally, learning about the healthcare situations in these countries will enable me to consider launching my healthcare-related startup across the region simultaneously.

While writing the answer to this question, I already came up with the idea of creating a new startup: a youth talks platform to keep us engaged even after the events. This virtual extension of the Youth Talks would include events, group discussions, chats, and streaming to maintain the connection and continue the collaborative spirit online. These four days of living and talking together will inspire me to build this platform, ensuring the vibrant community continues to thrive beyond the physical event.
