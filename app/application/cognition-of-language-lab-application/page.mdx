# Cognition of Language Lab Application: Advance Linguistic Research

Dear Dr. Karimi,

I hope this message finds you well.

My name is Ibrohim Abdivokhidov, and I am writing to express my interest in joining the Cognition of Language Lab (CoLLab) at Mississippi State University. I am particularly drawn to your research on the cognitive processes involved in human language processing and the impact of cognitive decline on memory and language systems.

I have a background in Computer Science, specializing in Data Science, Machine Learning, and Advanced Software Development. During my internship at Dugree as an AI Researcher, I conducted research on several papers (listed below), which I have documented in slides and recorded lectures available on YouTube. This experience inspired me to delve into the intricacies of memory operations, including encoding, storage, and retrieval. Additionally, I have authored several Scopus-indexed research papers and book chapters.

I am eager to contribute to and learn from the innovative research being conducted at CoLLab. I believe that my skills and interests align well with the lab's objectives, and I am excited about the opportunity to collaborate with and learn from esteemed researchers like yourself.

Please find my CV and relevant academic transcripts attached for your review. I am available at your convenience for further discussion about how I can contribute to the lab's ongoing projects. Thank you for considering my application.

I look forward to the possibility of contributing to your team and furthering my research career under your guidance.

Warm regards,

Ibrohim Abdivokhidov
