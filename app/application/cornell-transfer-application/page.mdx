## In the aftermath of the U.S. Civil War, Ezra Cornell wrote, "I would found an institution where any person can find instruction in any study." For over 150 years, Cornell University has remained deeply committed to Ezra\'s vision. Explain how your life experiences will help inform your contributions to a learning community devoted to “...any person…any study.” We encourage you to think broadly about your life experiences, including how local (e.g., family, school, neighborhood) or global communities you\'ve been part of have helped shape your perspective.

My life is a mosaic of diverse experiences, reflecting Cornell University's ethos. Born in Uzbekistan, I've navigated a society at the crossroads of tradition and modernity, developing a deep appreciation for education's power and the beauty of diverse perspectives. My unconventional educational journey has taken me from local classrooms to online learning platforms, embracing every opportunity to learn and grow. I've been both a student and a teacher, learning from seasoned professionals and mentoring young minds. A memorable experience was teaching coding to Amina, an underprivileged girl, highlighting the importance of inclusivity and accessibility in education.

My path has been shaped by mentors and peers, and the diverse individuals I've taught. True education, I've learned, transcends boundaries and disciplines, aligning with Cornell's commitment to "any person...any study." A defining moment was leading a team to develop software for a local hospital, showcasing the power of interdisciplinary collaboration and the importance of combining different fields to address real-world problems.

In conclusion, my journey has prepared me to thrive in Cornell's unique learning community, where innovation, inclusivity, and interdisciplinary collaboration are celebrated. I am excited to contribute to and learn from a community devoted to "any person...any study."
