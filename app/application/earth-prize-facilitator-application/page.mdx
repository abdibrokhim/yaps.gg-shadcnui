Hello, there!

I am Ibrohim. I am an AI guy. I have been interested in AI since my school years. When I was studying in 9th grade. There we had over 10 subjects. It\'s really crazy. I was curious about math, physics, and chemistry. However, I was too lazy to learn history, politics, geography, and similar stuff. We had 4 exams each year. And it was hard for me to get higher points from those boring subjects. Then, I randomly came up with an idea; what if I build an AI powered glasses with a built-in camera and projector on it. Camera is really tiny and not even visible. The process is very simple. Let\'s assume, I am in an exam and its history. Then I simply navigate the glasses camera to the question and AI will generate an answer and project it directly to the paper. I will simply copy and paste the answer. Answer will be visible only to me. Because I wore glasses. This project was the starting point of my journey into the AI world.

I want to become a certified facilitator at The Earth Prize because I believe in the power of untapped ideas to make a real difference. Every year, so many innovative ideas from The Earth Prize participants fall just short of advancing, and I want to help them reach their full potential. By becoming a facilitator, I can guide and support these ideas, helping participants strengthen their skills, mindset, and connections to turn eco-anxiety into eco-agency.

I have been mentoring since February 2023. When I first joined lablab ai. 
There I wrote tutorials on various AI technologies, and tools for over 100,000 developers. 
I mentored 10,000 teams to overcome technical challenges. Later on I joined Nobel Learning PBC. 
There I facilitated an Introduction to Design course for over 20 people. They all were from different countries and had different backgrounds. 
Then my sister asked to mentor and help her team in the Technovation Girls competition. 
Of course, I joined and did my best to support 7 young and curious school girls. At the same time, I started my YouTube channel. 
I still film tutorials there. When I joined HeadOn (prev. Dugree) as an AI Researcher, we did research on over 30 papers. 
At present, I am the 1st AI/ML API Regional Ambassador in Central Asia. Where, I help developers to integrate AI tools to their workflows. 
I am also a youth mentor at The Earth Foundation. An AI startup mentor at Moonshot Pirates. I love teaching others and sharing my knowledge. 
And last but not least, I\'m the Founder & CEO at Open Community. We Build Open-source AI-powered projects and tools to help people with stuff.

## Your Case Study Video Analysis (mp4 or equivalent)

Let\'s talk about case study 2; the school project debate. Let\'s also assume, I am the 10th member of this particular group. And our current task is to leave the meeting with a concrete plan. In this situation, I would simply raise my hand to speak out. Then, I would say; so guys, we already heard a couple of ideas from Devon and Saanvi. And Wei and Maya are also trying to deliver, speak and write their own ideas. So, we are already approaching the deadline. Let\'s make a poll and vote for each idea and proceed with the highest vote and start building and iterating. This is the best option for now. Let me quickly do this. Guys could you tell me your ideas one by one so I could draft them and drop the poll here on the chat.
