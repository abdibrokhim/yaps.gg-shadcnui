# The EITN EBRAINS Fall School in Computational Neuroscience

## Cover Letter

Dear EITN-EBRAINS Fall School Selection Committee,

I am writing to express my strong interest in attending the 2025 EITN EBRAINS Fall School in Computational Neuroscience (November 19–28, 2025, Marseille, France). I am a computer science student and undergraduate research assistant at New Uzbekistan University, with a background at the intersection of machine learning and neuroscience. The Fall School’s core topics - from cellular models and brain signals to circuit models and networks, mean-field models, and whole-brain simulations - align perfectly with my research experience and aspirations. I have focused on applying machine learning and advanced data visualization techniques to neuroscientific and software data, and I am eager to deepen my theoretical knowledge in these areas through EITN EBRAINS program.

In my academic and project work, I have sought to bridge AI and neuroscience. As the founder of CoMedAI (part of CoMed), an open-source project for AI-driven Brain MRI analysis, I developed tools to generate, manage, and report Brain MRI observations. This experience allowed me to apply machine learning models to real neuroscientific data and visualize complex brain imaging results for easier interpretation. During my undergraduate AI/ML research assistantship, I co-authored a peer-reviewed machine learning research paper (Springer, ICSDI 2024), gaining valuable experience in scientific writing and algorithm development. I have also conducted optimization research on cryptographic algorithms ASCON (by 49%)  and GOST 28147-89 (by 11.11%), focusing on memory usage and performance. In that project I learned to refine algorithms for efficiency - a skill directly applicable to running large-scale neural simulations and managing high-dimensional brain data. These projects have honed my programming (Python, C/C++) and analytical skills, preparing me to contribute meaningfully to the Fall School’s lectures, tutorials, and group projects. 

Attending the EITN EBRAINS Fall School will directly enhance the skills I need to achieve my long-term goals. My ambition is to improve data accessibility in neuroscience, build innovative software for brain-computer interfaces, and support underserved communities through technological empowerment. The training in multi-scale modeling and cutting-edge simulation environments will help me design better tools for organizing and visualizing neuroscience data, thereby democratizing access for researchers and students with limited resources. The knowledge I gain about network and whole-brain models will inform my development of robust BCI software - for example, understanding circuit dynamics could guide how I interpret neural signals in real time. Moreover, the collaborative environment will allow me to connect with experts and peers, fostering partnerships that can accelerate my plans to open-source neuroscience software and launch educational initiatives in my home country. Ultimately, the Fall School will empower me to turn my passion for neuroscience and engineering into tangible solutions for those who need them most.

I would also like to request consideration for the IBRO scholarship to support my attendance. I come from a low-income background in Uzbekistan and have been working part-time as a coding mentor (AI/ML API, Moonshot Pirates, The Earth Foundation) and freelance developer (Upwork) to finance my education. I do not have any institutional funding or grants to cover the costs of an overseas course. Without financial assistance, the travel and living expenses in France would be beyond my means. The IBRO scholarship would make it possible for me to fully participate in the program and focus on learning, and I am committed to using this opportunity to its fullest potential. This support would not only alleviate the financial burden on me but also enable me to bring the acquired knowledge back to my community - magnifying the impact of the scholarship by benefiting others through shared learning and future collaborations. 

In closing, I remain highly enthusiastic about the prospect of joining the 2025 Fall School. I look forward to exchanging ideas with and learning from the EBRAINS community’s experts, and to subsequently contributing to the EBRAINS platform and IBRO network as a passionate young researcher. Thank you very much for considering my application. I am excited about the opportunity to grow through this program and to give back to the community it represents.

Sincerely,

Ibrohim Abdivokhidov
