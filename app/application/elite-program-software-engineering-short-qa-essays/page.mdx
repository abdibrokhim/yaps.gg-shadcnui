### Extracurricular activities:

I'm a research-oriented student. I’ve a few book chapters and papers in the pipeline (on AI in marketing, GPT for healthcare, image tokenization, threat intelligence, etc.), and I even put parts 1 & 2 of my final graduation thesis on GitHub for the world to see.

More interesting stuff, I launched a meme coin ($OC) that went batshit viral – hitting a $4M market cap within an hour. I also built Yaps World, my open-source playground of viral projects (like Notlink, a Rust URL shortener that topped Product Hunt, and Yaps.chat, an encrypted anonymous chat that blew up on Hacker News for its insane UI/UX), and even hosted a global hackathon Open Community (307 hackers across 5 continents, judges from Snap/Meta/Google) without spending a single dollar on ads.

[Story Open Community]:
When I launched Open Community, I had zero budget. I pulled a stunt on social media by “retiring” from startups after “400+ failures” – that dramatic post blew up (~10k impressions in 24 hours) and got everyone curious. Next, I dropped the world’s first AI startup album (15 projects packaged like a mixtape) and even my friend’s mom was like “dang, this is cool,” so we knew it had cross-generational hype. Then I teased a “1 trillion API token giveaway” to create FOMO, but flipped it into a 72-hour hackathon with free API access. I even cold-emailed big-shot judges from Google, Meta, and YC who hopped on board, giving us cred without spending a dime. Result: 307 hackers from 10+ countries showed up and built 73 projects (3× our goal), 300+ people joined our community, 3 partnership offers rolled in – all with $0 spent on marketing.

I’m mostly known for following projects:
-PrepAlly - open-source ai coding prep platform, offering real-time feedback, voice-guided insights, and secure, interactive practice.
-PaperAI - open-source ai research companion that streamlines literature reviews, enhances real-time collaboration, and offers a smart voice assistant.
-CoMedAI (by CoMed) - open-source autonomous AI brain MRI analysis & diagnosis platform for doctors to help their patients.
