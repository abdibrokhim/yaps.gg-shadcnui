# Entrepreneur First Application: Build a World-Changing Startup

## What\'s the most impressive technical project you\'ve worked on? What was your role?

I worked on many projects that I\'m proud of. But, if I should select one it would be Report Cruncher. It is a financial analysis platform designed to simplify financial reports for retail investors using advanced machine learning. Leveraging the GPT-3 Curie model fine-tuned with the ECTSum dataset, it provides easy-to-understand financial insights, empowering retail investors to make informed decisions. During the OpenAI Stack hackathon, an ex eBay software engineer messaged me to team up. We had a diverse team including senior engineers, directors, founders, and financial managers. Hackathon was amazing. I still remember those sleepless nights. I was involved in both the front/back end development and model tuning process. Communication and collaboration was an essential part of the hackathon.


## Describe a time when you have used, or learned about technology to solve a problem.

Over the last 2 years, I have managed to help GreenWay Logistics Company automate various processes. I used a range of tools and technologies, including Python, JavaScript, Zapier, various SaaS APIs, and frameworks. I designed a few bots integrated with the Monday.com API to receive notifications, upload/download files remotely, and send specific files according to employees' roles. I built a scraper to gather leads. To automate reports and reduce time spent, I built a brand new mobile app using Flutter, Redux, and the Monday.com API. Reports are automatically written into a table. I utilized Zapier to connect the CentralCall API with the Monday.com API to save call recordings. Additionally, I wrote a Python script to serve as the middleman between the two APIs.

## What is the most ambitious goal you have ever set for yourself that you achieved?

I still remember those days. I was a 9th-grade student and wanted to be accepted into one of the prestigious universities in Uzbekistan. I set a goal to apply to INHA University in Tashkent (IUT). IUT was a great university for students passionate about Computer Science and shaping the world. From early 9th grade until the IUT entrance exam date, I studied and prepared for exams diligently. I moved toward being part of the IUT community. I focused on learning Physics, Math, and English. I was ready to endure hardships and move forward. Finally, my hard work paid off. I was accepted and had the chance to collaborate with a community of out-of-the-box thinkers.

## What is the next most ambitious goal you have ever set for yourself that you achieved?

My goal is to build CoMed, a patient-centric app designed to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of medical diagnostics. I envision a future where a supportive and interconnected healthcare community thrives, seamlessly connecting patients, medical professionals, and institutions to foster collaboration and knowledge sharing. After iterating through several versions of the app, I applied to Y Combinator (YC) to gain knowledge from world-renowned startup founders. YC provides valuable networking opportunities, which were a major attraction for me to apply. After a long journey, I received a rejection letter in my email inbox on June 1st. Despite this setback, I have learned to be resilient. I have no regrets and will continue to pursue every opportunity, regardless of the outcome.

Definitely ChatGPT by OpenAI. Over the last 1 year.


## What is one thing you believe about your future that others disagree with you on?
...

## What other opportunities are you considering?
I\'m a resilient and research-oriented student who embraces every opportunity, regardless of the outcome. I\'ll re-apply to YC this upcoming fall. Currently I\'m iterating over new versions of my startup at buildspace (backed by YC + a16z). Everyday I do research and apply for different research programs (e.g., OIST, KAIST) and internships (e.g., Anarchy Labs, Dugree). I aim to pursue a graduate degree, so that I can develop tools to address world challenges and shape the future. 


## Is there anything else we should know about you?

I aim towards helping others to achieve their goals. I love talking to people, supporting and encouraging them. When I saw their success I felt proud that I could change their life, I could influence them and become part of their long and not easy journey. I would say success comes different and it's different for everyone. Personally, I do not care if I am successful or not, however I do care that my step and action could change one's entire life into something they did not even imagine. Everything should be with facts, so to be honest till writing this paragraph I helped one more girl to work on her idea and just try it out, no matter the outcome, each action matters. I would highly encourage you to visit my personal website at abdibrokhim.vercel.app. I fully redesigned it. I will update it daily with interesting research, stories, and tutorials. I believe you will find a lot of helpful resources, tips & tricks and won\'t regret it.
