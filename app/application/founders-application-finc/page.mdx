## What's most the impressive thing you have shipped?

hey, wassap?!
i'm ibrohim abdivokhidov. or you can call me abee for short.
in the past i shipped bunch of different interesting projects. most of them i cooked during hackathons. so far i build over 60 projects. later on i selected 25 percent or 15 projects and put them over our website here ' theopencommunity.co ' . all of them has a potential to be a startup or be commercial product in the market. 
let's talk a couple of them. for example; 
comed (collaborative medicine). an open source ai powered platform transforming brain mri diagnostics to be easier, faster, and more accessible, especially in underserved rural areas. by integrating advanced ai into hospital workflows, we boost diagnostic accuracy from 84 percent to 95 percent and reduce waiting times from days to 15-30 minutes. targeting hospitals and clinics lacking advanced diagnostics and radiologists, we aim to bridge critical healthcare gaps.
prepally (an open source ai coding interviewer). current tools offer practice but fall short of providing the interactive, ai powered insights candidates need to feel truly prepared. interviews are still notoriously stressful, leaving candidates feeling unprepared despite available resources. prepally changes that by delivering real-time feedback and personalized insights, empowering candidates with the confidence and readiness to ace their interviews.
mewellai. an open source ai powered mobile app designed to revolutionize mental wellness support by combining the familiarity of social media with personalized mental health assistance. by leveraging specialized ai "agents" for specific mental health areas, mewellai provides users with accessible, engaging, and tailored support to improve their overall well-being. (itâ€™s like a social media app. there are specific agents for specific mental illnesses.)

## What are you thinking about building?

at the moment i am cookin' something people want. i am building paperai: the open source collaborative ai research platform. researchers and scholars often face challenges like information overload and time-consuming literature review. aside from making personal notes, paper ai enables users to annotate, discuss collaboratively and ask ai for quick summary on complex points across a piece of article or research paper. it fosters a shared learning ecosystem and encourages collaboration across disciplines and geographic boundaries. it's still on early stage of development. we shipped mvp and some professors got interested what we were building. it'll be the #1 best ai platform for researchers to do their research on research papers. youtube; https://youtu.be/E7d1rLyXXVE . github; https://github.com/abdibrokhim/paper-ai-voice-assistant . website; https://paperai.pro/ .
