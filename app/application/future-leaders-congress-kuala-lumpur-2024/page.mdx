# Future Leaders Congress 2024 in Kuala Lumpur

## What are your motivations to apply for Future Leaders Congress Malaysia? (100-150 Words).

I envision the future where a collaborative and inclusive approach will solve the environmental challenges. I plan to start a multi-faith climate action network in Uzbekistan. We all unite in diverse religious communities to address the pressing issue of climate change. It gives us an opportunity to advance the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), promote peace-building, and foster diplomacy.

Beyond the fellowship, I will maintain and expand this interfaith climate action network. I will continue to engage with the fellowship alumni. In Faith For Our Planet network we will share best practices and collaborate on international climate initiatives.


## How would your community benefit from your participation after this program? (100-150 Words).

Let’s take the community as a whole, one country, or even people living on our mother earth. It's a fact that day by day, our air is getting worse. My current research focuses on building AI-powered hybrid filtering systems. Specifically, I built an AI-powered hybrid filter that combines five filters. To output maximum clean flue gas, these three filters are structured in the following order: 1) ESP, 2) Combined Fabric and Nanofiber-Based Filters (Baghouse), 3) Wet Scrubber. Integrating AI will hugely impact potential failures or maintenance needs before they occur. Also, it will dynamically adjust the operational parameters of each filter based on the incoming flue gas characteristics to optimise filtration performance. Participating in the event would give me a promising opportunity to get feedback and build a network of supportive peers, mentors, and industry experts with whom I could shape the idea and launch as a startup.


## Tell us about your achievements in the Educational/Social Sector and what is your opinion about achieving SDGs with the help of AI and Data? (150-200 words).

Last year, I joined TechVisionaries Research Group, a student-led organisation at New Uzbekistan University focused on Neuroscience - Brain MRI research. TechVisionaries aims to contribute to a brighter future for our mother world, advancing the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals making MRI diagnosis easier, faster, and cheaper using artificial intelligence and deep learning. I worked solo to pre-train the model and build a software to generate, manage and report Brain MRI observations. Our model outperforms GPT-4o, and generates medical diagnostic conclusions with higher accuracy in natural language. Inspired by the results, I wrote a research paper on “Enhancing Medical Accuracy: A Comparative Study of Pre-Trained GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4 Models.”. Recently, I founded the Open Community, bringing together over 150+ developers, designers, and builders with a shared interest in shipping cool products using AI and Data. Currently, we are actively participating in the hackathons with a solid vision building a more inclusive future. We also won several ones. During my time at Dugree, I led an initiative to enhance our platform's ability to facilitate engaging and constructive discussions on difficult topics including poverty, hunger, climate change, extremism, and human rights discrimination. We conducted thorough research on over twenty cutting-edge papers.
