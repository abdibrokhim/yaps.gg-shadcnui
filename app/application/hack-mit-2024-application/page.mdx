# Hack MIT 2024: Innovate at MIT\'s Leading Hackathon

## Which specific events, activities, or opportunities at HackMIT are you most looking forward to, and why? *

I wish to gain new insights and enhance my skills through the workshops and mentorship. I’m the one who values continuous learning. And I’m looking forward to the opportunity to collaborate with MIT students and be inspired by the innovative spirit of the community. I'm curious about what it is like to be an MIT student. I want to understand how they approach problem-solving, think creatively, and apply their knowledge in practical ways. I know MIT is the number 1 institute. I think their mindset and way of thinking are renowned for being exceptional. They are always surrounded by cutting-edge technologies and practical learning opportunities in the labs. Wow, I can’t even imagine how my mind would be shaped after HackMIT. Teamwork is integral to the MIT experience. Collaborative projects and research are the core part of their education. I can’t wait to feel the vibe. I hope to adopt some of their best practices, learn potential ways to tackle complex challenges, and integrate their unique approaches into my own problem-solving toolkit. I’ve brothers and a sister whom I want to help and share my journey with to motivate them in their future studies.


## Tell us about your background. How much coding experience do you have, and in what languages, or do you have other skills that you hope to use during the hackathon weekend? *
Don't worry if you don't have prior experience: You do not need experience to attend HackMIT. We'd also love to hear about any other skills you'd like to use at HackMIT: these could be related to art, music, hardware, design, or anything else you're interested in!

I've been in IT for 5 years. I’ve 2+ years of hands-on experience in different fields including web/mobile app and software development, UI/UX design, and AI model tuning. I usually code in Python, TypeScript/JavaScript, Dart and have intermediate knowledge in Java,  C/C++, R, Swift, GraphQL, PostgreSQL, Rust. I use frameworks such as Flutter, React, Django, Flask, FastAPI, Next.js, Tauri, PyTorch, and TensorFlow. I prefer the following tools: Redux, Postman, Jira, Git, Colab, Firebase, Docker, Tailwind CSS, and ChatGPT. I would love to use all my skills to make something people want. I believe soft skills play a crucial role in team formation. As a leader I’m resilient who felt enough of the dose of pain and suffering. Listening to others ideas and opinions will definitely move towards success. I’m really good at Prompt Engineering. Over the last two years I closely collaborated with different AI tools.


## What are your strengths and weaknesses as a team member? What role do you tend to take on in a collaborative setting? *

I’ve been in many hackathons. Often I see that I’ve weaknesses in pitching. Sometimes I forget some words or be silent for a moment. To be honest I tend to be more technical like a CTO. I know which tool or technology and how to use it properly. Building scalable softwares is the stuff I enjoy. However, I’m also a good communicator. I like talking, exchanging ideas and learning from each other. We all have unique strengths and weaknesses. I believe by teaming up together we can complement each other.


## What motivates you to hack, and what do you hope to get out of attending HackMIT? *

The number one thing that pushes me to keep hacking is to build something people want. In the hackathons time is limited. You should ship faster, think creative, iterate over multiple ideas, communicate and listen to various unique views. I just love these. I believe HackMIT will be incredible and remarkably different from the rest of hackathons that I’ve ever attended. A series of livestreamed tech talks, workshops, and speaker events will give me an opportunity to learn from the leaders. MIT itself is the number 1 university in the world. Staying overnight with MIT students, sharing meals, and experiencing the atmosphere/vibe is another chance to immerse myself in the HackMIT community and forge lasting connections. I’m pretty sure, I will return to my home country with lifetime memories.


## Tell us about a project that you're proud of, technical or non-technical! How and what did you learn in the process of working on this project? How did you take advantage of resources around you to make it happen? *

I worked on many projects that I’m proud of. But, if I should select one it would be Report Cruncher. It is a financial analysis platform designed to simplify financial reports for retail investors using advanced machine learning. Leveraging the GPT-3 Curie model fine-tuned with the ECTSum dataset, it provides easy-to-understand financial insights, empowering retail investors to make informed decisions. During the OpenAI Stack hackathon, an ex eBay software engineer messaged me to team up. We had a diverse team including senior engineers, directors, founders, and financial managers. Hackathon was amazing. I still remember those sleepless nights. I was involved in both the front/back end development and model tuning process. Communication and collaboration was an essential part of the hackathon. By choosing the proper technologies and tools we could both save time and reduce bugs.
