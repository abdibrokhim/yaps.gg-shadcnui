# Hack the North 2024: Canada\'s Premier Hackathon Awaits

## 1. What would dreaming big at Hack the North look like for you? (400 characters)
Make something people want. These four words carry immense meaning. People are diverse, and their desires evolve. I take risks and suffer, solve problems, inspire change, and innovate in ways that touch lives. I push boundaries and seek opportunities to collaborate with diverse builders. Inspired by the community's spirit, I'm driven to shape the world. It's all about dreaming big, at least.


## 2. Tell us about something you worked on that brought a passion to life. What inspired you to get started? (1200 characters)


In the last hackathon, I faced some issues while working with Langflow (https://github.com/langflow-ai/langflow). As a beginner to this platform, I struggled to determine which components connect to which edges and had some issues with the drag-and-drop functionality. Then I thought, what if I automate the whole process using AI? It would be an AI-powered AI, haha. So, I integrated voice input into Langflow. I used OpenAI’s Whisper API for transcriptions and GPT-4 for understanding human instructions and generating JSON nodes. It worked! We came up with a cool one-liner for our project description: “We automated Langflow with AI. No more drag and drop; simply dictate, and AI gets the work done!” It sounds so promising. As I write this, we have already received five stars in all four categories. It’s so cool! Compared to traditional drag-and-drop methods, we even saved 4 seconds when building a simple chatbot (https://youtu.be/d9eJJHAp8v8). Project is Open Source (https://github.com/abdibrokhim/langflow).

## 3. Tell us your favorite joke! (1200 characters)

I want to highlight the statement of Joanna Maciejewska. She said: “I want AI to do my laundry and dishes so that I can do art and writing, not for AI to do my art and writing so thạt I can do my laundry and dishes.”.
