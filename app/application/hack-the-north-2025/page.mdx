# Hack the North 2025

## Tell us about your journey so far, what keeps you moving forward, and why you are passionate about building things! [1500 characters max.]

My journey as a software engineer, AI researcher, and community builder weaves together 3 academic programs, 8 industry roles, and 7 extracurricular leadership positions. I’ve launched over 60 open-source AI projects, led a global hackathon with 307 participants across 10+ countries, and skyrocketed a meme coin to a $4M market cap in just 1 hour. My full-stack expertise powers healthcare and automation innovations like CoMedAI, an AI app for brain MRI diagnosis with 85% diagnostic accuracy, and PaperAI, an AI research companion that cuts literature review time by 50%.

I spearheaded a hackathon that birthed 73 real-world apps, and 4,200+ in cash prizes. For my thesis, I optimized cryptography algorithms, boosting ASCON by 11.11% and GOST 28147-89 by 49.38%, processing 1,000+ test cases in under 2 weeks. Curiosity drives me – over 400 rejections, including 3 from Y Combinator, sharpen my resilience. I thrive on tackling complex challenges, shipping 60+ projects, and mentoring 200+ developers to success.

Building fuels my creativity and impact. From healthcare tools to educational platforms, I’ve automated 10+ workflows, saved clients 20+ hours/month, and scaled apps to 10,000+ users. Mentoring excites me most – empowering 200,000+ learners through masterclasses and guiding 10,000+ teams to prototype 1,500+ AI solutions keeps me energized.


## Using methods of forecasting, to the best of your approximations, what is the hacker acceptance rate at Hack the North? [800 characters max.]

I am not sure tbh. But hackers with good portfolios (e.g., past hackathons, good team collaboration skills, no day off for hackathons rather than college, just chill guys who can cook some stuff in a limited time) always will be accepted. because they know how to make hackathon even cooler. Moreover, newbie hackers with high motivation and collaboration skills also have higher chances to be accepted. why not? Let's make this "Hack the North" their first fun hackathon.


## By the year 2030, what do you think will be one commonly accepted idea society will reject? [800 characters max.]

By 2030, society will reject the belief that human cognitive abilities are fixed and cannot be greatly enhanced by technology. Advances in neurotechnology, like Neuralink’s brain-computer interfaces, will show that integrating these tools in early childhood—when neuroplasticity peaks—can vastly boost learning and skills. Just as missing early sensory input can impair development, early use of neurotech will unlock extraordinary cognitive potential, making today’s idea of static limits obsolete and reshaping future generations’ productivity.

PS: Why I'm talking about BioTech? Because, I've deep interest in Neuroscience, Computational Neuroscience, Neurotechnology.


## What is the most exciting thing you've ever built?

I’m actively building ANORA - Intelligent Canvas for Infinite Creativity. Just finished refactoring the third version of ANORA’s Investor Pitch Deck. We’re raising $100K USD to bring AI Agents with Version Graph into ANORA to 10x accelerate the Creative Process. Basically ANORA tackles the inefficiency and lack of creative control in today’s Softwares and AI (slops) tools by offering a single, node-based canvas that blends drag-and-drop ease with granular parameter controls and seamless integrations to top AI APIs (currently we’re partnering with AI/ML API (aimlapi.com)) – letting professional teams rapidly generate, tweak and iterate high-quality images, video, audio and text without mastering complex traditional software or settling for generic AI outputs. You can try ANORA yourself (here: anora.yaps.gg) and share on X (twitter). We're excited to see what you create.

In the past I built so many cool things (here: yaps.gg/thing). Most of them during hackathons (ps: i participated over 70 hacks). For example: 
1. One of the most starred projects; Notlink – a blazingly fast URL shortener ever built with Rust programming language. It is designed to be simple, secure, and fast. notlink is open-source and free to use. It is also fully customizable and can be self-hosted on your own server. (fork: https://github.com/abdibrokhim/notlink).
2. Next thing; Douaa - The first open-source AI Agent for OLX (olx.uz). Agent helps you just list the products on olx.uz marketplace without any knowledge of olx.uz. (fork: https://github.com/abdibrokhim/douaa). I built this with my Freshman/Sophomore bros at New Uzbekistan University.
3. The; Eliza: AI Agent Orchestration. Featuring Wei - The Enterprise-Grade AI Agent For Personal Growth with advanced memory, real-time search, and comprehensive analytics. I really enjoyed building this project. It’s comprehensive enough. So I also wrote multiple tutorials for others to learn. (tutorials: https://www.yaps.gg/tutorial). (fork: https://github.com/Anora-Labs/eliza-agent-orchestration/tree/keywordsai-intg). 
I can continue the list infinitely. (less is more). But let me share one more project that I’m really proud of. CoMed - Open-source fully autonomous AI Brain MRI analysis & diagnosis platform for Doctors to help their Patients. This is my failed (almost) startup. I worked on this for a pretty long time. I also authored a paper that will be published soon by Springer and Indexed in Scopus. Read history of CoMed: (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BUTYwI5xuNIV0FWmmQNmMErs6XXK30kDKoojktSwoJU/edit?usp=sharing).

And last but not least, I’m always excited to share my knowledge with others, help them to build stuff, and find their unique path (not default path). My tutorials are openly available (here: yaps.gg/tutorial). Programs, fellowships, scholarships, masters applications wherever I’ve applied – all I open-sourced (here: https://yaps.gg/application). 

I’m from Uzbekistan. And if you look into my history of the past 2 years (here: https://yaps.gg/wrapped). These are one of the incredible achievements for me (whoever) lives in Uzbekistan (we’re still a young developing country). [ps: not my words].


## We love problem-solving - after all, that’s what hacking is all about! Share your favourite riddle or brain teaser with us (and don’t forget the answer - we’re curious too!).

I dunno whether we can count this as a brain teaser, however lemme share it. since i love Neuroscience, here's my question; What are the chances to make Neurolink AI-powered or built brand new BCI AI-chip? So we could search info super fast using AI Agents right inside our brains, learn things fast, and tons of interesting things. 
tbh, this is incredible.
