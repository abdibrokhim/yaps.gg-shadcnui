# Headstarter Fellowship & Accelerator: Propel Your Startup

## This accelerator is competitive: Justify why you deserve a spot. This accelerator is the first-step to being vetted as top-talent. Share in detail what you did in the last 4 months that shows career preparedness.

Over the last four months I was involved in different activities. In the very beginning of May I submitted Abstract for the DKU Conference 2024, about my research titled 'Analysing the Role of Neural Networks in Forecasting Climate-Related Events.'. It was accepted and Serik fully covered my flights+lodging to attend the conference Almaty, Kazakhstan. During the next three months I constantly participated in different hackathons. I collaborated with individuals from diverse backgrounds and nationalities. We won a couple of them. At the same time, I participated in other challenges and competitions held by different companies. Later on I was accepted for the headstarter software engineering fellowship, 7 weeks program. I built five AI startups using various tools. Engaged in weekly 	meetings with engineers from Google, Y Combinator etc. Parallel I completed my Seeds For The Future 2024 program. During a week I was involved in different activities together with 150 students from 14 countries, over 10 mentors and experts, and past year winners, ambassadors. I also continued my AI research internship at Dugree where we discussed research papers and how to properly implement them in real world scenarios. In addition, I collaborated in a team of three to automate Langflow with AI to automatically build components through voice commands, enabling a ready application in less than 11 seconds. Interesting part is, I wrote several research papers and submitted them for peer-review. Moreover, I completed Prompt Engineering for ChatGPT (Vanderbilt University), and Data Software Engineering (part of Masters degree Epam Systems). Meanwhile, I applied for different conferences, and events, waiting for results. And last but not least, I am keeping building my startup by iterating over features and fully upgrading.

To be honest, I really want to contribute to Neuralink as a Software Engineer or AI Researcher. Over the last 6 months I got interested in Neuroscience. But after Lex Fridmanâ€™s 8 hours podcast even more. I am struggling to get an internship offer from well-known companies such as Spotfy, Snapchat, Meta, Neurolink, and TikTok. I am pretty sure I can survive in those companies. Even though. I have a strong CV and software engineering background and not only. Every week I build some stuff, and collaborate with diverse people in hackathons, competitions, and challenges. I am different because I suffered a lot. I build projects from the very ground till the end including, pitch-deck, business plans, presentation slides, official project websites, and etc. I would really be thankful, if you could help me even with a 3 months internship in those above mentioned companies or YC backed startups that can sponsor VISA for onsite or work remotely. Or even could you contact the stripes? I think you have a good connection with them. It would be nice if they support Uzbekistan. I have dozens of projects that I need to integrate stripe API and done. I am the next Pieter Levels @levelsio from twitter.
