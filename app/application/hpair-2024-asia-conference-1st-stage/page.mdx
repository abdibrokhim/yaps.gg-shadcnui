## Reflect on a time in which teamwork was essential in accomplishing a goal. What role did you play in this team environment? Building on this experience, how do you envision collaborating with others at the HPAIR Asia Conference? (200 words max)

In my very first hackathon, I was part of a diverse team of professionals. We all worked together to plan and manage the implementation of a cutting-edge financial analysis platform designed to simplify financial reports for retail investors. Our ability to communicate effectively was what made us such a good team. Each day, we met to share the current state of our project. Perhaps the greatest challenge we faced together as a team was time management. Because everyone on the team comes from different areas all around the world, we've all learned so much about big ideas, from finance to tech. As the youngest member of the team, I understand what it means to be a part of something bigger than myself. Through collaborative efforts, I've learned the value of working in harmony with others to accomplish a shared goal. We ended up getting accepted as one of the eight finalists among 503 teams. I believe HPAIR gives me an unforgettable opportunity to bring my leadership to contribute to meaningful discussions with passionate individuals and learn from them.

## If you could have a 5 minute conversation with anyone in the world, who would it be, and what would you talk about? (200 words max)

I would talk with Ilya Sutskever, the AI scientist shaping the world. I would highlight his philosophy and deep curiosity about the nature of consciousness. I have tons of questions and would spend hours talking with Ilya Sutskever. Unfortunately, I have 5 minutes and I should be unforgettable. I would ask him if it is true that you have seen AGI. If yes, what does it look like? After the progress of OpenAI and the huge difference between GPT-3 and GPT-4o (omni), sometimes I think that it should be something unimaginable. Next, what kind of unusual things should we be ready for? We already saw AI replacing jobs in various fields including medicine, education, and mainly in programming. Education is evolving and becoming more accessible for everyone. AI is increasingly automating our repetitive tasks and now we have enough time to spend for our family. But what more? And last but not least,  How do you see the future in 10 years? I know it is crazy to imagine, maybe AI with human-level intelligence is likely to happen soon, or deep neural networks will push them to learn feelings such as crying as we humans usually do.

## Describe a problem or challenge in your community that you've started to tackle. What motivated you to take action, and in what ways do you believe participating in HPAIR would advance your efforts? (200 words max)

Recently I have facilitated a team of 5 girls who were passionate about AI and how to utilize it in medicine for the benefit of humanity. They were still young, just normal school girls. But their burning eyes told me something unusual. They wanted to ship a startup, instead of sitting in a classroom. Their curiosity to learn new things, research different topics, and communication skills motivated me. Initially, it seemed challenging for them to code, design a product, or calculate and make financial plans. But, they believed they could master it. Every day, we had meetings and I tried to explain everything in detail, answer their questions, and encourage them to move forward. I also filmed a few videos, so they can always rewatch them and stay on track. I am sure empathy is the key in every team. Participating in HPAIR Asia Conference would expose me to a global network of innovators, mentors, and leaders in the field, allowing me to gain invaluable insights and expand my horizons.

## Please use the space below to provide any additional information or detail any extenuating circumstances you would like us to know. (100 words max)

I know the deadline has already passed for scholarship. However, I want to express my deepest interest to participate in the HPAIR Asia Conference. Even if I will be accepted, my financial constraints may limit my attendance. I also know that the budget is limited and may already be utilized. But I believe there is â€¦ . I hope this will not be a barrier to being part of something bigger.
