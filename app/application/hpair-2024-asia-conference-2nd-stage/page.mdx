1.Hi, I’m Ibrohim Abdivokhidov senior student at New Uzbekistan University majoring in Computer Science, Software Engineering. I’m interested in AI and its applications. Automating repeated tasks, and saving more time to spend with family, walk in the fresh air, talk to people, do the things that we love. I am passionate about healthcare. Health is one of the number one things that drives every person. If you feel sick or have even a little headache sometimes you don't want to do anything except laying down and looking above. I am building an interactive, secure, supportive platform that connects patients, doctors, and hospitals in a dynamic, interactive community. Where people can support each other and share empathy. Where professional medical doctors can talk with patients, encourage, and motivate them to look at life from different perspectives. Where hospitals and clinics are part of an ecosystem that not only enhances the healthcare experience but also builds a bridge between healthcare professionals and patients.
2.Recently I have facilitated a team of 5 girls who were passionate about AI and how to utilize it in medicine for the benefit of humanity. They were still young, just normal school girls. But their burning eyes told me something unusual. They wanted to ship a startup, instead of sitting in a classroom. Their curiosity to learn new things, research different topics, and communication skills motivated me. Initially, it seemed challenging for them to code, design a product, or calculate and make financial plans. But, they believed they could master it. Every day, we had meetings and I tried to explain everything in detail, answer their questions, and encourage them to move forward. I also filmed a few tutorials, so they can always rewatch them and stay on track.
3.I learned to be resilient. I learned to be empathetic. I learned a lot of essential skills that now reflect in my projects, and teamwork. For example: I am a youtuber and I film different tutorials. But after the challenge, I started to explain things more clearly and in detail. I am sure empathy is the key in every team.
4.if i would describe myself in three words it would be; Creative, Resilient, Empathetic.
I am curious and open-minded. I always try to think out of the box. I do take risks and It’s normal stuff for me. I generate tons of ideas and few of them are unimaginative for normal people. For example: yesterday I submitted my startup project for the hackathon. I came up with the idea to build an ai powered app for mental wellness, MeWellAI. Sounds too general? But what if the app is fully AI based, you will chat with ai, you will learn mental well-being from courses and training made by ai, like, comment, and share ai posted posts, follow and connect with ai mental wellness agents. AI will decide when and what to post based on their specialization. It may seem crazy stuff, but it will be normal in nearest future. 

As Jensen Huang said in one of his interviews “I wish you ample dose of pain and suffering”. I suffered a lot and I am thankful for that. All the difficulties and challenges shaped me who I am now. I do love just “trying it out” new things no matter the outcome. For example: let’s back to MeWellAI. I built it in 2 days solo. It was hard. I had to build a fully functional mobile app, prepare a presentation, film demo video, write a detailed project roadmap and its value in the market.Yeah it may seem hard. However, I had fun building. I do remember sleepless nights and that feeling is just another that can’t be expressed by words.

I have a really good imagination. I can imagine how someone else feels. I can imagine the situation. I can imagine the nearest future based on current time. It’s weird. If there are 10 active listeners in a room. Of course, I am the one. Over the last 3 years I have collaborated with many people from different countries and nationalities, from different backgrounds. And it helped me to better understand different perspectives.

5.personally, I love music. Both listening and making. I would love to dive in one more time and cook some cool vibes.

6. I am interested in participating in the conference to connect with leaders who are passionate about innovation and social impact. Also there will be nobel laureates and industry innovators, I would love to engage in potential discussions. I believe it provides me invaluable learning and networking opportunities. This experience will not only broaden my perspectives but also inspire me to apply to my startups including healthcare, AI. One of my goals is to integrate AI solutions in healthcare, ultimately improving patient outcomes and contributing to global healthcare systems. I would love to travel to Bangkok and talk with people. See the culture. 

7.i do not have any questions. But I have a tiny request. I know the deadline has already passed for scholarship. However, I want to express my deepest interest to participate in the HPAIR Asia Conference. Even if I will be accepted, my financial constraints may limit my attendance. I also know that the budget is limited and might already be utilized. But I believe there is … . I hope this will not be a barrier to being part of something bigger.
