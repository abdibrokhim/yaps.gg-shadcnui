I bring a strong background in AI research and a proven ability to drive innovation and collaboration. As an AI Research Intern at Dugree, I implemented advanced research initiatives, such as the SOTOPIA-π framework for training socially intelligent language agents improving constructive conversation rates by 30%. My leadership qualities—resilience, creativity, and empathy—were crucial in developing Langflow AI. We aimed to automate the Langflow platform using AI, moving beyond the traditional drag-and-drop interface to a voice-command-based system. Through this I could contribute to Open Source.

In addition to my academic work, I am an active member of the IT Community of Uzbekistan, where I lead initiatives that support growth and technological advancement for over 4,000 young tech enthusiasts. 

I have over 5 research papers, that one also was indexed in Scopus.

I have proven experience in building supportive and fun communities. One of my strong skills is to organise and mobilise diverse groups towards common goals. Let’s take Open Community as an example. I found it to foster collaboration between over 150 tech builders, designers, storytellers, and creators from diverse countries and nationalities including India, Uzbekistan, USA. In Open Community we build startups within SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals) including waste reduction, water conservation, and reforestation efforts.
