IES SoSe 2025 / Invitation to Skype interview on 26.10.2024

What was your biggest achievement so far?

Could you tell me about your successful project?

What are you expecting from IES?

How do you overcome pressure?


What animal would you consider yourself? (just imagine) [i said unicorn, because i am startup]

They will ask questions based on your CV for real. For example: I wrote that I mentored 200K youth including developers. They asked for proof. I explained how it was. And also they asked you to write that you worked at a startup before. What did you learn from that experience? …and etc. questions. So, make sure to include all that true w/o false information.

How can you contribute to Copernicus Berlin during your volunteering days? (i said that i teach them, because i already have experience).

What are your goals? (it would be better to speak about both short term and long term goals.) as I did.

There could be additional two more guys from the last program. If so they will definitely ask additional interesting questions. So be ready for that also. One of them asked how I learned C and C++ languages and what I did like projects or whatever. Another asked something from my CV. 

And last but not least, some general questions; Are you ready to contribute to the growth of Copernicus Berlin? Are you really available for the full term of the scholarship program? What kind of places would you like to visit during the program? …and other interesting and basic questions.

Just be true to yourself and keep it simple and communicate. Be a storyteller.
