# IRENA Youth Forum: Pioneering Renewable Energy Leadership


## Please describe the project or initiative you have been involved in (or you are planning/willing to start) that demonstrates your dedication and commitment to sustainable energy development and climate action.


Last year, I joined TechVisionaries Research Group, a student-led organisation at New Uzbekistan University focused on Neuroscience - Brain MRI research. I worked solo to pre-train the model and build a software. Our model outperforms GPT-4o. Inspired by the results, I wrote yet another research paper.

Recently, I founded the Open Community, bringing together over 150+ developers with a shared interest. We are all from diverse countries and nationalities including India, Uzbekistan, USA. Currently, we are actively participating in the hackathons with a solid vision building a more inclusive future focusing on sustainable energy development and climate action.

I wrote over five papers and book chapters that were indexed in Scopus and accepted in upcoming Conferences. Let’s take my latest paper on “Enhancing Trade and Investment Patterns in Central Asia with AI and Machine Learning.”. I presented in person at DKU Conference 2024, Almaty, Kazakhstan last week, 7th September. Another, yet interesting research on “Analysing the Role of Neural Networks in Forecasting Climate-Related Events.”, holds the potential to address complex challenges in climate action.

During my time at Dugree, I led an initiative to enhance our platform's ability to facilitate engaging and constructive discussions on difficult topics including poverty, hunger, climate change, extremism, sustainable energy and human rights discrimination. We conducted thorough research on over twenty cutting-edge papers.

One of my key initiatives is the founding of the Open Community, which brings together over 150 developers from diverse countries, including Uzbekistan, India, and the USA, to collaborate on technology-driven solutions for sustainable energy development and climate action. Our community is actively participating in hackathons with a focus on developing software and AI models to improve energy efficiency and renewable energy deployment.

A notable project we're working on is a climate forecasting tool that leverages neural networks to predict extreme weather events and assess their potential impact on renewable energy infrastructure. This project aims to help governments and companies better prepare for climate-related disruptions, ultimately improving energy resilience.

Additionally, I’ve authored a research paper titled 'Analysing the Role of Neural Networks in Forecasting Climate-Related Events,' which explores the potential of AI in addressing complex climate challenges. I presented this research at the DKU Conference in Almaty, Kazakhstan, further demonstrating my commitment to using advanced technology for climate action.

At Dugree, I led an initiative to foster discussions on global issues, supporting over 30 research projects on using technology to advance climate action.

In the future, I plan to expand the Open Community’s efforts by collaborating with energy sector experts to create scalable tech solutions that can support the global transition to clean energy.




## What are your expectations from participating in the IRENA Youth Forum, and how do you envision it contributing to your personal and professional growth?


I envision the future where a collaborative and inclusive approach will solve the environmental challenges. I plan to start a multi-faith climate action network in Uzbekistan. We all unite in diverse religious communities to address the pressing issue of climate change. It gives us an opportunity to encourage education, advocacy, and community-driven environmental projects.

Participating in the IRENA Youth Forum opens big doors of opportunities for me. Meeting in person with climate-conscious young leaders from around the world helps me to generate new ideas. Being involved in interactive workshops, seminars, and debates strengthen my network and connect with diverse thought leaders, and IRENA experts. I believe I will gain promising new skills to apply the value-based framework rooted in faith to effectively address climate change.

Beyond the IRENA Youth Forum, I will maintain and expand this interfaith climate action network. I will continue to engage with the forum alumni, Heads of Government, and Ministers to advance the energy transition. I will also amplify the voices of underrepresented communities in global sustainable energy development discussions. It’s important that their perspectives are heard on the world stage.

As a long-term goal, I will expand my Open Community and establish a formal organisation supporting interfaith climate action in Central Asia. It will provide ongoing education, resources, and support for faith-based environmental initiatives.


#### GPT’s version (shortened):

I expect the IRENA Youth Forum to be a transformative experience that will provide me with the knowledge, skills, and networks necessary to accelerate my efforts in addressing climate change. By engaging with climate-conscious young leaders and IRENA experts, I anticipate gaining new perspectives and practical insights into renewable energy deployment and sustainable development strategies. The interactive workshops and debates will allow me to strengthen my leadership and advocacy skills, which are crucial for advancing my initiative.

On a personal level, I see this as an opportunity to sharpen my ability to lead diverse, interfaith climate initiatives, while also broadening my global perspective on energy transition. Professionally, I will build a robust network of global thought leaders and policy-makers that will support the establishment of a multi-faith climate action network in Uzbekistan. The skills and relationships I develop at the Forum will directly contribute to my long-term goal of founding a formal organisation that advances faith-based environmental action across Central Asia.

My current research focuses on building AI-powered hybrid filtering systems for reducing emissions in energy production, particularly in bioenergy plants. This system, which combines ESP, nanofiber-based filters, and wet scrubbers, dynamically optimises performance using AI to enhance efficiency and sustainability. By minimising harmful emissions, it supports cleaner renewable energy generation. I believe participating in IRENA youth forum will provide valuable feedback and opportunities to collaborate with climate-conscious young leaders and industry experts to refine this project and explore its startup potential.

In addition to this project, I am actively working on a research paper titled 'Analysing the Role of Neural Networks in Forecasting Climate-Related Events.'. Traditional methods often struggle with the complex patterns in climate data, but neural networks have demonstrated proficiency in identifying correlations within vast datasets, enabling more precise predictions of extreme weather events such as hurricanes, heatwaves, and heavy rainfall. This advancement has the potential to significantly improve disaster preparedness and response strategies. My paper explores both the practical applications and challenges of implementing neural networks in climate forecasting, with studies showing up to a 20% reduction in prediction errors compared to conventional models. This work aligns with my broader goal of leveraging technology to address climate change and further supports the need for innovative approaches to mitigating its impacts.
