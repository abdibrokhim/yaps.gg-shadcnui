I connected with one girl who was accepted to the internship. She talked about this promising opportunity to engage in real-world research and software building.


I've been in IT for 5 years. I’ve 2+ years of hands-on experience in different fields including web/mobile app and software development, UI/UX design, and AI model tuning. I usually code in Python, TypeScript/JavaScript, Dart and have intermediate knowledge in Java,  C/C++, R, Swift, PostgreSQL, Rust. I use frameworks such as Flutter, React, Django, Flask, FastAPI, Next.js, Tauri, PyTorch, and TensorFlow. I prefer the following tools: Redux, Postman, Jira, Git, Google Colab, Firebase, Clerk, AWS EC2, Stripe API, Docker, Tailwind CSS, and ChatGPT. I would love to use all my skills to make something people want. I believe soft skills play a crucial role in team formation. As a leader I’m resilient who felt enough of the dose of pain and suffering. Listening to others ideas and opinions will definitely move towards success. I’m really good at Prompt Engineering. Over the last one year I closely collaborated with AI.


Last year, I joined TechVisionaries Research Group, a student-led organisation at New Uzbekistan University focused on Neuroscience - Brain MRI research. TechVisionaries aims to make MRI diagnosis easier, faster, and cheaper using artificial intelligence and deep learning. I worked solo to pre-train the model and build a software to generate, manage and report Brain MRI observations. Our model outperforms GPT-4o, and generates medical diagnostic conclusions with higher accuracy in natural language. Inspired by the results, I wrote a research paper on “Enhancing Medical Accuracy: A Comparative Study of Pre-Trained GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4 Models.”. Overall, TechVisionaries has been instrumental in deepening my interest in Neuroscience.

I’m also super active in Hackathons, and Open Source software development. Since founding Open Community we even faster started to execute ideas, automate different tasks, and build something people want. Open Community aims to make a positive impact in the community by gathering highly motivated people with diverse backgrounds and nationalities. In my recent project, I worked in a team of 3 people to recommend the usage of artificial intelligence to integrate voice command into Open Source software, leading to a decrease in average build time by 33% and ship AI agentic apps faster. It again proves my good organisational skills, ability to work effectively often according to tight deadlines.

And last but not least, I plan and conduct research independently in a wide range of subjects. I wrote over five papers and book chapters that were indexed in Scopus and accepted in upcoming Conferences. Let’s take my latest paper on “Enhancing Trade and Investment Patterns in Central Asia with AI and Machine Learning.”. I will be presenting in person at DKU Conference 2024, Kazakhstan this coming September. Currently, I am doing research on optimising AlphaFold (predicts protein’s 3D structure) using Quantum computing and advanced algorithms.

I am a senior student at University. Currently, I am working on my graduation thesis. Time-to-time I may participate in the upcoming hackathons. In general, I am able to meet with my company from 7 am to 12am and 7pm to 2am on Weekdays. From 7 am to 12 am then from 2 pm to 2 am on Weekends. I am mostly flexible. Just let me know what time works best for you also.


To be honest, I want to study our nervous system in depth, particularly the brain, and how it influences our behaviour, cognition, and emotions. I want to explore the structure and function of neurons, neural circuits, and how they interact to regulate everything, including basic biological processes and complex psychological phenomena. I did not choose Neuroscience by chance; it is interdisciplinary, combining biology, psychology, chemistry, physics, computer science, and even philosophy to understand the brain's role in health, disease, and behaviour. As part of a research internship, I am planning to focus on Cognitive Neuroscience. It is a promising opportunity to work alongside a research mentor, writing coach, and publication specialist. I aim to write a thesis or paper on how brain functions relate to mental processes such as memory, attention, language, and problem-solving. Recently, I watched an 8-hour podcast, episode #438, Lex Fridman with Elon Musk, on Neuralink and the Future of Humanity. The impact of Neuralink on humanity is incredibly significant. Listening to DJ Seo, COO & President of Neuralink, further motivated me to pursue Neuroscience for my Master's and PhD.
