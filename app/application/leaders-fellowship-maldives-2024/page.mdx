# Leaders Fellowship Maldives 2024: Empower Future Changemakers

## Please provide details of your education and any certifications that are important in your life journey (250 words or less)

I am currently a senior Undergraduate student at New Uzbekistan University (NewUU) is Uzbekistan’s first comprehensive research university where research and education are integrated. I am majoring in Computer Science - Software Engineering. My academic and professional interests lie in scalable software development, artificial general intelligence and advanced deep learning. Specifically, I apply artificial intelligence to promote policies that will improve the economic and social well-being of people around the globe. 

Last year, I joined TechVisionaries Research Group, a student-led organisation at New Uzbekistan University focused on Neuroscience - Brain MRI research. TechVisionaries aims to contribute to a brighter future for our mother world, advancing the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals making MRI diagnosis easier, faster, and cheaper using artificial intelligence and deep learning. I worked solo to pre-train the model and build a software to generate, manage and report Brain MRI observations. Our model outperforms GPT-4o, and generates medical diagnostic conclusions with higher accuracy in natural language. Inspired by the results, I wrote a research paper on “Enhancing Medical Accuracy: A Comparative Study of Pre-Trained GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4 Models.”. Overall, TechVisionaries has been instrumental in deepening my interest in Neuroscience and its applications.

I hold different promising certifications including Prompt Engineering for ChatGPT, Academy Accreditation - Generative AI Fundamentals, and Data Software Engineering. For example; Prompt Engineering for ChatGPT conducted by Dr. Jules White, Professor of Computer Science Vanderbilt University. This helped me to be an expert and create complex prompt-based applications for everyday life, business, and education. I could improve my productivity, execute, iterate over potential ideas to promote unity, and climate action within the community.


## How do you think your participation will help make the event more successful and diverse? (250 words or less).

What do you think is the number one thing to inspire positive change and leave a lasting impact on the global community? Of course, finding a common ground language. No worries, here I am. I have participated in dozens of different events and programs. I always bring to the table my unique perspective shaped by a diverse background and real-world experiences. Let’s take Huawei Seeds For The Future 2024 as a clear example. I unite 150 students from 14 promising countries to help them form meaningful relationships that extend beyond the event. Leaders Fellowship Maldives is yet another opportunity for me to make a global impact. I aim to share best practices and strategies that I have encountered in my own experiences to inspire fellows to contribute to a brighter future for our mother earth. I believe that both collaboration and networking are crucial in advancing the United Sustainable Development Goals. For example, since February 2023, I have been enriching my network globally for global betterment.


## How do you plan to connect with like-minded people during the event? (250 words or less)


I’ll keep in mind the top three skills, including active listening, seeking out common interests, and being proactive in approaching people. Personally, I am an open-hearted and very sociable person. People always say that it is so straightforward to make lasting connections with me. I believe it is because I have a diverse background. Given a topic like “AI in climate action” or “AI to empower community to global betterment,” and here we go, we spend hours and hours debating and reflecting on each other's opinions and thoughts. Additionally, I am planning to give a couple of speeches along with keynote speakers. I want to show a clear image of “being a leader” and how to unite individuals from different cultures and backgrounds to achieve common goals. The interesting thing here is, all of these combined will definitely lead to the birth of new startups that shape the future and make this world a better place!




## What are the major challenges in your community, and how do you plan to tackle them? (250 words or less)

Let’s take the community as a whole, one country, or even people living on our mother earth. It's a fact that day by day, our air is getting worse. If it continues like that, our next Gen-Z will definitely suffer from various crazy illnesses that will not only harm health but have a broader impact. How can we utilise artificial general intelligence to benefit all of humanity? Inspired by this question, my current research focuses on building AI-powered hybrid filtering systems. Specifically, I build a hybrid filter that combines five filters. Then, I apply machine learning algorithms to automate the whole process. To output maximum clean flue gas, these three filters are structured in the following order: 1) ESP, 2) Combined Fabric and Nanofiber-Based Filters (Baghouse), 3) Wet Scrubber. The process is simple as follows: 1) The ESP would remove larger particles from the flue gas, while the fabric filter would capture smaller particles, ensuring comprehensive filtration. 2) The wet scrubbing system specifically targets and neutralises harmful pollutants, such as sulphur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx). I simply divided the work, and each filter has its own responsibility. Integrating AI will hugely impact potential failures or maintenance needs before they occur. Also, it will dynamically adjust the operational parameters of each filter (e.g., voltage in ESP, fabric tension in Baghouse, pH levels in Wet Scrubber) based on the incoming flue gas characteristics to optimise filtration performance.


## Project title:

Dugree - AI for political discussions and not only.

## ​​Brief Description of the project/program (250 words or less)

Dugree is addressing the challenge of fostering healthy and unbiased conversations on controversial topics to combat tribalism, bias, and superstition. The goal is to encourage open dialogue and a culture of public discourse that leads to truth and societal progress, counteracting the current resistance to diverse communication.

During my time at Dugree, I led an initiative to enhance our platform's ability to facilitate engaging and constructive discussions on difficult topics. I conducted thorough research on cutting-edge papers, including; 1) SOTOPIA-π: Interactive Learning of Socially Intelligent Language Agents, 2) CLOVA: A Closed-LOop Visual Assistant with Tool Usage and Update, 3) Automatic Prompt Selection for LLMs, 4) Exploring Collaboration Mechanisms for LLM Agents:A Social Psychology View, 5) CGMI: Configurable General Multi-Agent Interaction Framework, 6) AUTOACT: Automatic Agent Learning from Scratch for QA via Self-Planning

My role was not only to understand these complex studies but also to translate their findings into practical applications within our startup (Dugree). I organised and led live lectures for our community of AI researchers, breaking down the research into actionable insights and guiding discussions to explore their potential.  

For example: When I implemented advanced research on “SOTOPIA-π framework for training socially intelligent language agents” and the “CLOVA closed-loop visual assistant”. Results showed improving constructive conversation rates by 30% and allowed us to develop more targeted and context-aware dialogue prompts, which enriched the relevance and depth of our discussions. Additionally, it sparked new ideas for future research, aligning with Dugree's mission to promote open and unbiased dialogue.
