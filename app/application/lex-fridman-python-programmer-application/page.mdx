# Lex Fridman Application: Python Programmer Opportunity

## If you have experience programming in Python, please explain the extent of your experience and what kind of projects you've work on with it?

I have 2+ years of experience programming in Python. I have closely worked with this language during hackathons, startup projects, self projects, university projects, automation, scraping, machine learning, data science and many other fields. Python is just a cool programming language that can be used almost everywhere. In the past, I have automated over 10 workflows, and all my backend side of applications whether it is web, mobile or desktop are written in Python, except a few of them that were written JavaScript/TypeScript and Node.js. Furthermore, I have a YouTube channel where I explain Data Structure and Algorithms, How to build apps, automate, and also I write tutorials for lablab.ai on different AI topics which are more Python oriented with the Streamlit framework. In short, I have proven experience in the Python programming language.


## If you have experience programming in JavaScript (includes TypeScript), please explain the extent of your experience and what kind of projects you've work on with it?

I have roughly 1 year of experience programming in JavaScript/TypeScript. Throughout my time at Souk e-commerce startup company, I closely worked with JavaScript/TypeScript including Next.js to build admin dashboard to control mobile app process (e.g., show sponsored projects, apply filters, control, add or approve products, and etc.). Moreover, I utilized JavaScript/TypeScript for my own projects and hackathons, for example: I build NFT generator & minter on testnet using Alchemy SDK, build web app that helps to learn more from YouTube videos, and almost all my frontend side utilizes JavaScript/TypeScript. In short, I have proven experience in JavaScript/TypeScript programming language.

## If you have experience programming in PHP, please explain the extent of your experience and what kind of projects you've work on with it?

To be honest, I have a little experience in PHP. I have learned for the first time at University on my Freshman year. 


## If you have other programming experience not covered above, please explain the extent of your experience and what kind of projects you've work on with it?

Actually, I am highly customisable engineer. Over the last 3 years I have worked with various programming languages, frameworks, tools, concepts, and many more, including C/C++, Python Core, Java, Dart, R, TypeScript, JavaScript, Swift, HTML, CSS, SQL, PostgreSQL, Rust, Flutter, React, Django, Flask, FastAPI, Streamlit, Next.js, Tauri, GCP, Firebase, Redux, Postman, Docker, Material UI, Tailwind CSS, and 3rd party SDKs. 

For example, I have built WeShot a new type of social media where the moments are not just captured but shared using Flutter, Redux, Firebase, Flask, FastAPI, and 3rd party SDKs (Stripe, Gemini, GPT). Mobile App? I always go with Flutter.

Next, recently using Rust, Tauri, next.js, and JavaScript/Typescript built MacOS based desktop application. Like ChatGPT clone. Why did I tried Rust? Because it supports build and try it out on my MacBook without need apple developer account where Flutter requires it.

Using Java/JavaFX I was involved in building desktop application LMS, and also full backend side was done by me using Python and Django. This was first big team project.

Swift I learned last year at my University and certified by Apple itself. I build CrunchGPT that accepts PDF no matter the size and pages on it, and you need to ask related interesting questions and agent will answer based on uploaded PDF. Its like chatbot that really helps to learn more via communication. It also powered by Firebase, ChromaDB, OpenAI Embeddings.

C/C++ I have used for my Data Structure and Algorithms course.

I recently finished my Data Software Engineering course by Epam Systems. I gained some knowledge using PostgreSQL and other tools including Hadoop, Big Data, Data Analytics and Science, DevOps.


As I am a self-taught engineer, I mostly worked with various engineers worldwide and gained proven knowledge in the developing including  managing, planning, and collaboration skills. 

First project I would like to talk about is WeShot, a social media where moments are shared. I was fully divided into it, cause the idea itself was just amazing. I drafted the notebook, what technologies I will use, programming languages, frameworks, concepts, and 3rd party services. Then, I made a UI/UX design using Figma. Beginning with the backend I make sure that we have a solid database and API. Time by time added authentication, 3rd party services. After testing functionality using Postman, I started building a mobile application. App was separated into different parts or folders, including UI, services, epics, redux, and helpers. UI was responsible to output what was fetched from API (just dummy UI, but user friendly). Services were responsible to send API requests to backend and get the response. Epics were responsible for selecting specific services. Redux just dispatched the actions and updated states if needed. I also have unit tests, to ensure widgets are working correctly. Everytime while updating the source code, I make commits and they reflect the changes made. After everything is done. Release a new version on Github with relevant tags.

Second project I would like to outline our last project that we made on Technovation Girls 2024. There I served as a Mentor. I planned the project timeline using notion.so and divided tasks among girls as their desire, experience and interest. To make sure everything went smooth and be ready by deadline, we had weekly meetings. I made tutorials on YouTube as well, so they could learn, build, and execute their solution faster and proper. Prepared all the helpful external sources, and submission requirements so their journey was enjoyable.

Actually, I see myself as CTO, I have proven experience in different tools, and what to choose and why. How we can build something fast and ship it. Scalable and maintainable solutions. And many other things.

I would say automation several repeating tasks, I\'m good at automation workflows. Also, analyze YouTube channel, including comments, views, and other infographics, so we can involve a massive audience. Creating newsletters. There are a lot of things we can do, let\'s brainstorm together.

You are a YouTuber and I really appreciate your podcasts and questions, talking style and manner. You have talked with different well-known Scientists, Engineers, CEOs which is unbelievable. Moreover, you are a Research Scientist at MIT, the number one University worldwide. I saw your few lectures on YouTube and was inspired. Maybe, we will work on a new research paper. I\'m a resilient student and author of a few research papers and articles.


While most people try to work hard putting in a lot of time and effort to complete specific tasks. There are few people who prefer working smart using efficient methods and strategies, prioritizing tasks to minimize wasted effort. Personally, I believe balance is the key. The best approach is often to combine working hard and working smart. I would put in the necessary effort while also using effective strategies to ensure the work is done efficiently and effectively at the same time.
