# Neurolink Application Cover Letter

## We look for evidence of exceptional ability. Please provide us with three examples highlighting your exceptional ability, using quantitative metrics to display the impact on a product/project related to the requirements of the position you are applying for. Each bullet should be very concise— no longer than 3-4 sentences each and should capture the problem, solution, and result. We recommend starting with an action word (designed, led, built, promoted, launched, created, etc.) and be sure to include technical detail. This is your moment to WOW us! NOTE: Answering this question fully is the most important part of our interview process. 

The current process of Brain MRI analysis and management is inefficient and lacks advanced predictive models, and there is a need for a platform that fosters community engagement among patients and healthcare professionals. To address the challenges I've built Medicord, a comprehensive software solution that consists of three main products: Brain MRI Analysis and Management System, Advanced Image Processing and Feature Extraction, and Community and Collaboration Platform. As a result, I got accepted into Microsoft for Startups Founders hub. I love the medical sector and working on healthcare softwares, and always try to help people, because it’s really cool (happiness) to see when people smile.

I've built over 10+ automation tools for my girlfriend (she works at Logistics) to make her life easier. Here are a few of them: saving call records from RingCentral in Monday.com workspace, receiving notifications and downloading required files from Monday.com on Telegram bot when status changes, using Zapier. Build a mobile app using Flutter to decrease time spent to send reports to required Logistics companies. Automate Google sheets for better experience while working. As a result, she has more time to spend walking with friends, being around family, talking with me (haha), and etc. I am a Software Engineer, and my job is to make people's lives easier and more enjoyable, while replacing human work with automations (robots, bots, automotive tools), I can say, “proud to be helpful”.

I've mentored and written tutorials on various trending AI topics/tools/technologies, aimed to help over 100,000+ Lablab.ai community builders to understand and implement AI techniques in their projects smoothly. Builders always faced issues with implementing new tools and technologies into their projects and building startups or any helpful product. There were a bunch of new techs (every day a new tool was born) and even they had documentation, but no one had time to go through each of them (documentation) and spent time just reading and understanding them. Here I am, writing hands-on and easy to understand, short but clearly guided tutorials for AI enthusiasts, and also we did many video/voice calls via Discord, so I could help them succeed and share my knowledge for free.
