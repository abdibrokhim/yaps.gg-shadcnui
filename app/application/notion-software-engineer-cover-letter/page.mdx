# Notion Cover Letter: Secure Your Software Engineering Role

Hi!

I love using Notion every day. No more Google Docs. In Notion, I can easily manage all my stuff in one workspace. I have used Notion many times, including for hackathons, research programs, managing projects, and shipping solutions in challenges and contests. Notion is kind of (or exactly) a user-centric platform.

I would really appreciate working at Notion for multiple reasons:
- "Make something people want." Notion is used by millions of people every day. It makes the journey smooth. For example, we also use Notion to manage the entire database at Dugree.
- Have fun while working on serious projects. Notion has tons of built-in widgets and services, including third-party integrations. It makes it easy to connect different applications in one platform and automate the whole process.
- A resilient team. I watched the co-founders' story of Notion, Akshay Kothari (COO) and Ivan Zhao (CEO), on building Notion. Nine years of hustle to achieve a single goal.
- Be part of a supportive family, collaborate, and ship new features.

I keep my answer simple and concise. I would love to relocate and start a new journey, even if it's a 3-month internship. It's a huge opportunity to grow and shape the future platform for the coming billions of lovely users of Notion, all in one platform.

All these are my own words from the heart. Nothing was generated by AI.
