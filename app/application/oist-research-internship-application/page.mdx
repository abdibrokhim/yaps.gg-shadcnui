# OIST Research Internship Application

## How does OIST and your desired research unit(s) fit with your current expertise and skill set? If you are interested in multiple research units, please explain your interest and fit for each briefly within one single statement.

How can we utilize artificial general intelligence to benefit all of humanity? Inspired by this question, my current research focuses on facilitating personalized, patient-centric healthcare. Specifically, I apply machine learning algorithms to move beyond one-size-fits-all treatments and tailor medical interventions to each patient's unique needs. This personalized approach aims to predict how each person will respond to different therapies, leading to more effective treatments and improved healthcare outcomes. It is with these broad visions in mind that I am applying for OIST Research Internship Program.


## What do you hope to accomplish at OIST?

Specifically, I would be excited to work with Associate Professor Yamada Makoto. Professor Yamada is a leading expert in machine learning and data science, with significant contributions to developing efficient algorithms for real-world applications, including medicine. His research on generating 3D medical images using GANs aligns perfectly with my research interests in applying AI to healthcare.

Today, personalized medicine is revolutionizing healthcare by tailoring treatments to individual patients. Seeing the critical challenge of radiologist shortages, especially in rural areas or underserved communities, I aim to develop advanced machine learning algorithms and apply them to medical data analysis, particularly to my startup. One of my goals is to co-author research papers on these innovations and submit them to top machine learning conferences. I am eager to collaborate with other leading professors and students, fostering a network that could lead to future research collaborations and potentially a new startup venture based on our work.


## How does a research internship at OIST fit into your overall career plans/aspirations?

As a research-oriented university student, participating in OIST Research Internship Program is the most effective way to explore new opportunities and shape the world. Although I spent a year learning Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning at Academy. While studying full-time, I have also worked part-time in a startup, as a research assistant, writing tutorials, mentoring, and facilitating. Through these valuable experiences, I not only learned about the many real-world challenges that made me more resilient, but also discovered research interests that would allow me to address some of those challenges. After the research program, I aim to pursue a graduate degree, so that I can develop the research and tools to address these challenges and more. Furthering my research at OIST research internship program would bring me one step closer to my goal of advancing data-driven decision-making in a wide range of fields and ultimately improving patient outcomes and making a meaningful impact on global healthcare systems.
