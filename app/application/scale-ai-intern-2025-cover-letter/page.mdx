# Scale AI Software Engineering Intern 2025: Cover Letter Tips

Dear Hiring Manager,

After searching for internships particularly in San Francisco, CA, I came up with a Software Engineering Intern (Summer 2025) at Scale AI. I realized that the Software Engineering Intern position is truly a great fit for me. As a Computer Science major at New Uzbekistan University in Tashkent, my academic and professional interests lie in software development, artificial intelligence and machine learning. Specifically, I apply software engineering methodologies and artificial general intelligence to build highly scalable softwares that will accelerate the growth of new qualified contributors on Scale\'s labeling platform. I am eager to learn more about generative AI, defense applications, and autonomous vehicles challenges and see where I can put into practice the skills I have gained through my academic, internship, fellowship and extracurricular experiences.

Last year, I joined TechVisionaries Research Group, a student-led organization at New Uzbekistan University focused on Neuroscience - Brain MRI research. TechVisionaries aims to make MRI diagnosis easier, faster, and cheaper using artificial intelligence and deep learning. I worked solo to pre-train the model and build a software to generate, manage and report Brain MRI observations. Our model outperforms GPT-4o, and generates medical diagnostic conclusions with higher accuracy in natural language. Inspired by the results, I wrote a research paper on “Enhancing Medical Accuracy: A Comparative Study of Pre-Trained GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4 Models.”. Overall, TechVisionaries has been instrumental in deepening my interest in Neuroscience and its applications.

My very first internship was at Souk ecommerce/online marketplace startup company as a Fullstack Flutter Developer. Specifically, we focused on Algerian, French, German, and Arab countries markets as our initial launch. At Souk I collaborated closely with the Founder & CEO of Souk, facilitating daily communications via Zoom, Google Meet, and Discord VC to align development efforts with strategic business objectives. Moreover I enhanced the performance of mobile app by 60%, ensuring smooth operation across various devices. I was also involved in developing AI models for the product information generation (e.g., name, year, manufacture, color, brand, and etc.) by the uploaded image(s).

I\'m also super active in Hackathons, and Open Source software development. Since founding Open Community we even faster started to execute ideas, automate different tasks, and build something people want. Open Community aims to make a positive impact in the community by gathering highly motivated people with diverse backgrounds and nationalities. In my recent project, I worked in a team of 3 people to recommend the usage of artificial intelligence to integrate voice command into Open Source software, leading to a decrease in average build time by 33% and ship AI agentic apps faster. It again proves my good organisational skills, ability to work effectively often according to tight deadlines. We have a community on Discord, where we gather on interesting discussions. Together, we work on finding solutions to a range of social challenges, gain networking skills, and improve analytical and technical skills in a supportive environment.

And last but not least, I plan and conduct research independently in a wide range of subjects. I wrote over 5 papers including book chapters that were indexed in Scopus and accepted in upcoming Conferences. Let\'s take my latest paper on “Enhancing Trade and Investment Patterns in Central Asia with AI and Machine Learning.”. I will be presenting in person at DKU Conference 2024, Kazakhstan this coming September. Another, yet interesting research on “Analyzing the Role of Neural Networks in Forecasting Climate-Related Events.”, holds the potential to address complex challenges in climate action. 

I am truly excited about the prospect of applying my strong analytical, problem solving, and critical thinking skills to the Scale AI. In turn, this program will offer me an invaluable chance to learn more about developing new AI infrastructure products to visualize, query, and explore Scale data as an international organisation. I am available Summer 2025 anytime from May/June on a full-time basis. I appreciate your consideration of my application, and I look forward to speaking with you in greater detail about my candidacy.

Regards,
Ibrohim Abdivokhidov
