# Seeds for the Future Global Ambassador Election.

## Introduce yourself:

In short i am the first ai ml api regional ambassador in central Asia. I am the founder and CEO at open community over 170 developers. I participated in over 60 hackathons. I am the open source contributor at truth suite and langflow. till to date I have mentored 200K people. And authored 5 papers published by springer and indexed in scopus.

## What do you understand about the Seeds Global Ambassador Program, and why are you interested in participating?

I understand that the Seeds Global Ambassador Program aims to connect motivated individuals from around the world, equipping them with the resources, networks, and platforms to make meaningful impact through technology and community-building. As someone deeply engaged in open-source AI projects, mentoring over 200K developers, and fostering collaborative communities through Open Community, I see this program as a valuable opportunity to broaden my global perspective. By participating, I can share my experience in educational outreach and inclusive innovation, learn from industry leaders, and grow a worldwide network of peers. This would ultimately help me refine my mission of empowering people—especially those in emerging regions like my home country, Uzbekistan—through education, open-source collaboration, and accessible technology.

## What do you hope to achieve by participating in the Seeds Global Ambassador Program?

I want to join the Seeds Global Ambassador Program to help more people turn their ideas into real impact. As the founder of Open Community, I\'ve seen how sharing simple tools and open knowledge can help anyone grow. By becoming an ambassador, I can guide new talents, connect diverse minds, and show them how to build and learn together. This way, we can shape a brighter, more fair future for everyone.

## How do you define sustainability within community programs, and what specific practices would you implement to promote it effectively?

I view sustainability in community programs as something deeper than mere persistence—it involves shaping an inclusive environment where knowledge, resources, and opportunities naturally circulate among members. At Open Community, where I serve as Founder and CEO, we\'ve learned that sustainable growth hinges on empowering participants to co-create value, rather than relying on a single authority figure. This means designing clear paths for engagement: from newcomers learning the basics, to contributors mentoring fresh talent, and ultimately fostering leaders who help guide future directions.
To achieve this, I\'d focus on practices such as maintaining transparent documentation that demystifies every aspect of a project, from its technical underpinnings to the rationale behind certain decisions. Within Open Community, we\'re exploring well-structured mentorship pipelines—pairing seasoned contributors with novices—so that anyone who joins can quickly find guidance and gain confidence. Regular open forums, workshops, and knowledge-sharing sessions ensure that community members continuously exchange insights, refine ideas, and adapt to new challenges together. Over time, these practices encourage a dynamic, thriving ecosystem in which sustainability naturally emerges—one where people learn, innovate, and collaborate seamlessly, long after the initial spark of an initiative.

## Can you discuss a digital transformation project you have been involved in and its impact on community engagement?

From the beginning of 2023 I actively participating in the hackathons. To be honest I started because I was unemployed and need some cash to cover my own expenses. I saw that if I win one hackathon I could get $500 at least. It\'s pretty cool. But now I really happy that I didn\'t quit after over 60 loses. I am still the main hacker in the hackathons. Thanks to hackathons I could shaped myself and learned very diverse skills. I joined e-commerce startup and worked for 9 months there. I build over 60 projects. And at the same time I have mentored over 200K builders and creators. I also authored 5 papers. One already published by springer and indexed in scopus. The rest under peer review. Later on I contributed to open source startups like truthsuite (YC 23) and langflow (35K stars on github).
Then I realized that I should create one big community. Community where builders from different countries come together to build open source stuff. Here we go; welcome to open community. I\'m the founder CEO at Open Community. We build Open Source AI-powered projects and tools for people. We also write comprehensive and step-by-step tutorials on those projects and share across socials like LinkedIn, Medium, Dev, and our Discord community. So anyone, whether he or she is a beginner, a professional developer, or just a tech enthusiast, has a chance to learn how to build real stuff with AI. So far we build 15 potential projects available on theopencommunity.co . 
For example: 
- PaperAI: The Open Source Collaborative AI Research Platform. Researchers and scholars often face challenges like information overload and time-consuming literature review. Aside from making personal notes, Paper Ai enables users to annotate, discuss collaboratively and ask AI for quick summary on complex points across a piece of article or research paper.
- CoMed: The Open Source fully autonomous AI Brain MRI analysis & diagnosis platform for doctors to help their patients. It reduced wait times from days to minutes, boosting trust and engagement among local hospitals, patients, and rural clinics.
- PrepAlly: The Open Source AI-powered coding prep platform, offering real-time feedback, voice-guided insights, and secure, interactive practice.
> I have many young and old people who really cares about me and love what I do.

## Describe an experience where you effectively communicated a complex idea related to digitalization, innovation, entrepreneurship, or sustainability to a diverse audience.

During the Huawei Seeds for the Future program in August 2024, I presented our AI-powered diagnostic platform, CoMed (formerly Medivis), to an audience of over 150 participants from 15+ countries—ranging from engineers and medical students to startup founders and policy experts. To help everyone understand our complex solution, I broke down technical terms into simple steps, showed how AI models improve diagnostic accuracy from 84% to 95%, and illustrated how CoMed reduces MRI wait times from days to under 30 minutes. By using relatable examples, clear visuals, and a focus on real-world impact, I helped a diverse, multinational audience grasp both the core technology and the broader goal of improving global healthcare access. it was pretty simply for me, since I am all around to digitalization, innovation, entrepreneurship, or sustainability related projects, AI stuff , marketing, promotions, hype, and mostly online on X (formerly twitter) where everything happens in a crazy volume.
