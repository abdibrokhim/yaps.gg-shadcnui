# Shape the Future Challenge 2025 | Moonshot Pirates

## Why would you like to participate in the Shape the Future Challenge?

Participating in the Shape the Future Challenge provides me with a unique platform to actively contribute to shaping a healthier and more sustainable food system. My enduring curiosity about transforming the future of food has always driven my passion for exploring and understanding our digestive system. This hackathon not only allows me to apply my knowledge and creativity but also offers the invaluable opportunity to collaborate with like-minded students from diverse backgrounds.


## What role do you think alternative protein foods will play for your generation and future ones?

Alternative proteins are a big deal for me, my generation and future ones. They can help fix problems with health, the environment, and making sure everyone has enough to eat. As the world's population grows, these proteins offer a way to feed everyone without hurting the planet like traditional meat does. They're also healthier, often packed with good nutrients and fewer bad additives. For us, choosing alternative proteins means a healthier planet and better access to good food for everyone.


## What are the main challenges stopping people from choosing sustainable plant-based foods?

Plant-based eating faces some hurdles. These foods can be pricey and hard to find. Taste and texture are also issues; some people just don't think they're as good as meat. Cultural habits matter too; plant-based eating isn't everyone's tradition. Plus, it can be less convenient. People need to learn more about the benefits of plant-based diets for their health and the planet. Making these foods cheaper, tastier, and easier to find will help more people choose them.
