## Based on the work samples that you have submitted, please describe why you feel these demonstrate your software engineering skills for the Snap Engineering Academy. Tell us more about those projects (What was the goal? What was accomplished? How does this show your skills?) and explain how you want to further develop these skills.

### [Project 1]
- Medicord: Building a supportive ecosystem that enhances the healthcare experience for everyone involved.

#### What was the goal?
The goal of Medicord was to create a comprehensive medical software solution that streamlines the process of Brain MRI analysis, enhances diagnostic accuracy, and fosters a supportive community among healthcare professionals and patients.

#### What was accomplished?
Medicord has successfully completed Phase 1, which includes the implementation of a Brain MRI Analysis and Management System. This initial phase addresses the inefficiencies in diagnosis by providing an intuitive platform for radiologists to enter observations, generate diagnostic conclusions, and manage patient records. Phase 2 and Phase 3 of Medicord are in the pipeline, with plans to introduce Advanced Image Processing and Feature Extraction, and a Community and Collaboration Platform, respectively. These upcoming phases aim to further enhance diagnostic accuracy through sophisticated image processing capabilities and foster a supportive community among healthcare professionals and patients. My roadmap for Medicord demonstrates my strategic planning and forward-thinking approach in developing a comprehensive solution that addresses the evolving needs of the healthcare industry.

#### How does this show your skills?
The Medicord project underscores my adeptness in software development, AI integration, and fostering community within the healthcare technology domain. I showcased my command over computer science fundamentals by developing a cross-platform application using Flutter and managing backend services with Firebase's real-time database, authentication, and storage. I have fine-tuned the Google Gemma lightweight model, based on the Gemini architecture, with over 200 real data points for the MVP, demonstrating my proficiency in applying AI for predictive analysis. I plan to further refine this model using 3M real data points, leveraging resources from Microsoft for Startups Founders Hub, to which I have recently gained acceptance. My approach to data privacy and security is meticulous, ensuring the protection of sensitive medical information. Additionally, my pitching and presentation skills have been honed through this project, allowing me to effectively communicate complex technical concepts to various stakeholders.


### [Project 2]
- WeShot: A new era of social media—a platform where moments are not just captured but cherished and shared in their most authentic form.

#### What was the goal?
The goal of WeShot was to create a social media platform that emphasizes authentic visual storytelling, allowing users to share their moments in their most genuine form.

#### What was accomplished?
WeShot has successfully developed a fully functional application that boasts a range of features designed to enhance user engagement and storytelling. The platform offers a personalized feed that dynamically adapts to user preferences, ensuring that each user's experience is unique and tailored to their interests. With its intuitive design, WeShot makes capturing and sharing life's moments effortless and enjoyable.
One of the standout features of WeShot is its AI-powered content discovery and creation system. This advanced technology enables users to easily find content that resonates with them and encourages creative expression through the platform's editing and customization tools. Users can also engage with a diverse community by participating in challenges, sharing their shots, and connecting with others who share their passions.

#### How does this show your skills?
WeShot showcases my proficiency in developing user-centered applications that harness the power of cutting-edge technologies. My work on this project demonstrates my expertise in Flutter for cross-platform application development, Flask and Python for backend services, and the integration of Stripe for payment processing. I have also leveraged advanced AI models such as Gemini Pro Vision and GPT-4 Vision to enhance content personalization and discovery. Additionally, my use of Firebase for cloud services and authentication, along with the creation of a Postman API collection for efficient testing, highlights my ability to work with a diverse set of tools and frameworks to deliver a comprehensive and seamless user experience.


## Future Development of Skills:
I am passionately dedicated to advancing my software engineering skills through the exploration of emerging technologies and methodologies. My keen interest in research and rapid learning abilities drive my desire to delve deeper into the realms of machine learning and artificial intelligence, with the goal of developing smarter and more adaptable systems. My curiosity about AI fuels my ambition to transform any application into an AI-based one, showcasing my adaptability and forward-thinking approach.

Joining the Snap Engineering Academy presents a unique opportunity to learn from some of the world's best engineers, engage in technical workshops, and collaborate on challenging projects. This experience would not only sharpen my existing skills but also provide me with new tools and insights to innovate and excel in my future endeavors in software engineering. I am excited about the prospect of immersing myself in an environment that fosters growth, creativity, and the pursuit of excellence in the ever-evolving landscape of technology.

Upon completing my Bachelor's degree, I intend to pursue a Software Engineer internship at Snapchat, with the aspiration of joining the Snapchat family. But why, you might ask? My fascination with Snapchat stems from its innovative approach to social media and its commitment to pushing the boundaries of technology. As a platform that has consistently been at the forefront of augmented reality, real-time communication, and creative expression, Snapchat represents an environment where I can both contribute and grow. I am particularly drawn to the company's culture of creativity and collaboration. By joining the Snapchat team, I aim to immerse myself in cutting-edge projects, learn from experienced professionals, and ultimately, make a meaningful impact in the world of social media and technology.
