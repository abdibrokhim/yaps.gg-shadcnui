## Tell us about two of your most interesting projects.

In short; First project that I'm really proud of is Medicord - a supportive ecosystem that enhances the healthcare experience for everyone involved. The main idea of building Medicord was to create a comprehensive medical software solution that streamlines the process of Brain MRI analysis, enhances diagnostic accuracy, and fosters a supportive community among healthcare professionals and patients. My work on this project demonstrates my expertise in Flutter for cross-platform application development, redux for app's state management, integration of Firebase for real time database and handling authentication, FastAPI & Python for backend services, designing entire UI/UX of application, fine tuning various models for predictions, and pitch deck. Next project that looks interesting is WeShot - a new era of social mediaâ€”a platform where moments are not just captured but cherished and shared in their most authentic form. The goal of WeShot was to create a social media platform that emphasizes authentic visual storytelling, allowing users to share their moments in their most genuine form. WeShot showcases my proficiency in developing user-centered applications that harness the power of cutting-edge technologies. My work on this project demonstrates my expertise in Flutter for cross-platform application development, Flask and Python for backend services, redux for app's state management, and the integration of Stripe for payment processing, and Postman API collection for efficient testing. I have also leveraged advanced AI models such as Gemini Pro Vision and GPT-4 Vision to enhance content personalization and discovery.
