# World Food Forum 2024: Good Food for All

## Tell us about your work experience in the field of agriculture, water resources, nature conservation and climate change (150 words max.)

I have conducted research on AI in Climate Change, with a focus on neural networks for forecasting climate-related events. My abstract, "Analyzing the Role of Neural Networks in Forecasting Climate-Related Events," explores how these advanced algorithms enhance the accuracy and reliability of climate predictions. Traditional methods often struggle with complex climate data, but neural networks excel in identifying patterns and correlations. This work examines their application in predicting extreme weather phenomena, showing a potential reduction in prediction errors by up to 20%. The chapter discusses practical applications, benefits, and challenges, emphasizing the transformative impact of neural networks on climate forecasting and disaster preparedness. It was submitted and accepted by IntechOpen under the book "Complex Systems With Artificial Intelligence."



## Do you run a project or a startup? If yes, please describe it in detail (200 words max.)

I'm Ibrohim Abdivokhidov the Founder & CEO & CTO of CoMedAI.

CoMedAI an AI powered mobile application to generate, manage and report Brain MRI observations.

CoMedAI is a product of CoMed, develops innovative software solutions for healthcare, focusing on advanced tools that enhance medical diagnosis accuracy and foster a supportive global community for professionals and patients.

Millions face challenges accessing quality healthcare, particularly when it comes to complex diagnoses like brain disorders. Lengthy wait times, potential for human error, and limited access to specialists hinder timely and accurate care. We’re driven by a commitment to developing technological innovations that enhance the accuracy and efficiency of medical diagnostics, ultimately leading to improved patient care and outcomes. We envision a future where a supportive and interconnected healthcare community thrives, seamlessly connecting patients, medical professionals, and institutions to foster collaboration, knowledge sharing, and a patient-centric approach to healthcare.

## Please describe your experience participating in conferences and forums (150 words max.)

I will be attending the DKU annual conference "Central Asia's Transformations: Politics, Economy, and Society" from September 6 to 8 in Almaty. Previously, I participated in the 2nd International Conference on Sustainability: Developments and Innovations (ICSDI 2024). At ICSDI 2024, I presented research titled "Machine Learning Based Image Classification with COREL 1K Dataset," which explored innovative approaches to sustainability using machine learning techniques. This conference, held at Prince Sultan University in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, recognized our valuable contributions to the field of sustainability and innovation.



## If selected to participate in this year's World Food Forum, how do you plan to contribute, and what benefits do you hope to gain from the program? (150 words max.)

If selected for the World Food Forum, I plan to contribute my research on leveraging neural networks for climate event forecasting, which can improve agricultural planning and food security, directly aligning with this year's focus on "Good Food for All, for Today and Tomorrow." I'm passionate about using technology to ensure accessible and resilient food systems for everyone. I will actively engage in panel discussions and collaborative workshops, offering insights and learning from others. I hope to gain a deeper understanding of innovative practices in sustainable agriculture and climate adaptation, build connections with global experts, and identify opportunities for collaboration to advance my research. Ultimately, I aim to contribute to creating sustainable and resilient food systems worldwide, ensuring good food for all, both now and in the future.
