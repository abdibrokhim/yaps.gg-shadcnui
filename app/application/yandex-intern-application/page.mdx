# Yandex Internship: Launch Your Tech Career in Russia

## Tell us about your academic interests:
- topic of your thesis or coursework
- research and academic projects
- academic subjects you enjoyed the most

I have a strong interest in AI and Neuroscience and have written several research papers, including "Analyzing the Role of AI in Enhancing Customer Experience through Personalized Marketing," "Machine Learning-Based Image Classification with the COREL 1K Dataset" (published by Springer and indexed in Scopus), and "Analyzing the Impact of Image Tokenization for Efficient Generation of High-Resolution Images."
During my time at university, I thoroughly enjoyed coursework in Machine Learning, Data Science, Computer Science, and Mobile Programming. As part of my final exam projects, I completed several interesting projects, such as WeShot (https://github.com/abdibrokhim/weshot) and CoMed (https://github.com/abdibrokhim/CoMedAI-App).

## Describe what tasks you would be interested in doing during your internship.

During my internship at Yandex, I am interested in working on three key areas. First, I would like to focus on Rider and Driver Behavior Analysis, where I would analyze patterns to identify factors influencing customer satisfaction, ride cancellations, and driver retention. The goal would be to generate insights that improve user experience, reduce churn, and optimize driver allocation. Second, I am eager to develop an AI-Driven Personalized Recommendation system that offers hyper-personalized ride or food suggestions based on historical data, real-time preferences, and contextual factors like time of day or weather. This would help increase user engagement and order frequency. Lastly, I am keen to contribute to Fraud Detection and Prevention by analyzing transaction data to identify and mitigate fraudulent activities, ultimately developing algorithms that protect the platform and its users.

Personally, I would consider "AI-Driven Personalized Recommendation" as priority number one.


## Tell us about your achievements - medals, diplomas, certificates, participation in Olympiads and awards, hackathons, scientific articles, successes in Kaggle competitions, and so on.
I have participated in over 50 hackathons and won five of them. I also authored a research paper that was indexed in Scopus. Additionally, I was accepted into both the Microsoft for Startups Founders Hub and Amazon Startups programs. My team successfully passed the first stage in the Seeds For The Future 2024 competition. I won the Buddy Pass Challenge, and Buildspace sponsored my trip, covering flights and housing worth $4,500. I ranked in the top 5% in a 14-day Ibrat Academy challenge, earning swag as a prize. I am a 2023 Registon LC Scholar, outshining over 80,000 participants to receive a $100 award. I was also awarded four months of free education at Registon LC for surpassing 49,000+ participants, valued at $200. Additionally, I was granted a full-ride scholarship for my undergraduate degree, valued at $16,000. Throughout high school, I consistently participated in math olympiads.
Moreover, I have completed certifications in Prompt Engineering for ChatGPT (Coursera), Academy Accreditation - Generative AI Fundamentals (Databricks), and Data Software Engineering (EPAM).


## If you have any work/internship experience, please tell us more about it.

During my time as a FullStack Flutter Developer Intern at Souk from April 2023 to November 2023, I worked closely with the Founder & CEO, maintaining daily communications via Zoom, Google Meet, and Discord to ensure alignment between development efforts and the company\'s strategic objectives. My primary contributions included enhancing the performance of Souk\'s mobile app by 60%, optimizing it with Flutter, Dart, Redux, and GraphQL to ensure seamless operation across various devices. I also developed over 50 reusable widgets and effectively separated business logic from UI, which significantly improved code maintainability and application scalability. Additionally, I built a comprehensive admin panel using Next.js, TypeScript, JavaScript, Redux, and Tailwind CSS, streamlining app management and enhancing administrative operations. I was also involved in developing AI models for generating product information, such as name, year, manufacture, color, and brand, from uploaded images.

Since June 2024, I have been working as an AI Research Intern at Dugree, where I am deeply involved in researching various topics in the machine learning field. I conduct presentations on these topics and actively engage with the research and presentations of other participants. This role has allowed me to expand my knowledge of AI while collaborating with peers to explore cutting-edge developments in the field.

## Why are you interested in an internship at Yandex, and what do you expect from it?

I am interested in an internship at Yandex because I want to work on real-world applications and gain valuable knowledge from senior engineers. I am eager to contribute to and enhance Yandex products, making a meaningful impact on society. I'm not expecting something incredible, however just have fun and make something people want; I believe it will provide me with hands-on experience and a dynamic work environment where there will never be a dull moment. I look forward to building new products and improving existing ones. Additionally, I am hoping to continue as an employee after the internship period.

## Anything else? Feel free to tell us about yourself

I want to share my one year story; from February 2023 to February 2024. I will try to keep it short and fun (hopefully). Sit back, relax, and enjoy!

I was studying at University, but I really wanted to earn some cash, haha, you heard it correctly, I needed some cash. However, I did prefer not physically, but online through my knowledge. And after some research, and browsing the internet, I found one website where everyone can participate and win cash as a prize. I liked it, then registered for upcoming hackathons.

Two hackathons passed, then I received a life-changing invitation (I did not know that time it would be life-changing) from a Chinese director and engineer to join a diverse team of senior engineers, developers, founders, and business leaders (we were 6 in a team) for the upcoming hackathon. This experience was eye-opening. The knowledge and insights I gained were priceless. I continued to immerse myself in hackathons, supporting beginners and collaborating with upcoming interns at Microsoft and Amazon, which further expanded my professional network.

Later, I got an offer from an Algerian senior engineer, and worked with him on a startup as Flutter Developer. Actually, I had zero knowledge in Flutter, but he said; "I give you time and mentor you, so you learn it". That was crazy! I worked with him for roughly 9 months, and learned to build real-world scalable full-stack applications. I also wrote a research paper in machine learning with my Professor, and tried mentoring and writing AI tutorials for AI communities with over 100,000 builders. Throughout my time at hackathons, startups, and writing tutorials, I was skilled in different programming languages, frameworks, tools, and concepts.

Furthermore, after AI became hyped all around the world, I have tried to build a company from scratch using only ChatGPT as an experiment (it worked out). Then, I applied for Microsoft for Startups Founders Hub and got accepted. Later, I created a YouTube channel to share my knowledge, but I keep tutorials fun. I\'m also active on LinkedIn (I have 3 badges, haha).

At present I'm a Senior student at New Uzbekistan University. Moving forward with the motto "Make something people want".
