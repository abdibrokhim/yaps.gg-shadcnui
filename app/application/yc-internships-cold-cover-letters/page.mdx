Hi, Nicolas Machado.

I hope you are doing well!

I'm Ibrohim, an undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science/Software Engineering. I just saw there is an open position for a Software Engineering Intern at Lume where you are Co-Founder, and I wanted to express my deepest interest and curiosity to join your team. I am a highly motivated, disciplined, and hard-working student who is excited to work in a start-up environment and willing to take charge to push the product forward. I am truly excited to collaborate closely with the founding team to shape the product vision and roadmap.

I have proven experience working with Python, FastAPI, Flutter, TypeScript, React, and Tailwind from my prior internship at Souk, where I enhanced the performance of their mobile app by 60% and built comprehensive admin panels. Additionally, my work on AI tutorials at Lablab.ai has equipped me with the knowledge of leveraging AI technologies, which aligns well with Lume's focus on automating data mappings using AI. The technical stack you use, including GCP, PostgreSQL, and Vercel, truly aligns with my past experience, and I have worked with each of these technologies.

I am excited to work in person in Manhattan, NY, and I am willing to relocate to be part of your dynamic team. My strong communication and collaboration skills, coupled with my resilience, make me a strong fit for this position.

Thank you for considering my application. Feel free to DM or reach out to me at abdibrokhim[at]gmail[dot]com or linkedin.com/in/abdibrokhim (I've already sent connect invite, hope you accept it).

Best regards,

Dear Piotr, I hope you're doing well!

I am writing to express my enthusiasm for the Machine Learning Engineer Intern position at Quickchat AI. Currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree (almost Senior student) in Software Engineering, CS, I am eager to apply my skills and passion for machine learning and conversational AI in a forward-thinking and dynamic environment like Quickchat AI.

This semester, I have really enjoyed my Theory of Computation course where I have learned about the foundations of computer science, including automata theory, computability, and complexity analysis. This course pushed me to further my analytical and problem-solving skills through rigorous mathematical proofs and algorithmic thinking. Last three years of my studies at New Uzbekistan University, I have gained hands-on knowledge in Computer Networks including Web & Mobile Programming, Data Science, Machine Learning, and Operating Systems.

My academic background and project experiences have equipped me with a foundation in technologies crucial for this role, including Python, PyTorch, and machine learning frameworks like fastai. I have a little deep understanding of machine learning theory and practice, but I everyday read some research papers and try to understand them, and I am particularly skilled in natural language processing, which I believe will be beneficial for building consumer products and business solutions on top of state-of-the-art language models like OpenAI's GPT.

I am drawn to this opportunity at Quickchat AI because of the company's commitment to innovation and learning. The prospect of working on ambitious projects and contributing to key parts of your technology from day one is incredibly exciting. My strong problem-solving skills, technical fluency in English, and ability to work efficiently both independently and as part of a team will allow me to contribute effectively to your projects.

I am excited about the opportunity to join Quickchat AI, contribute to building cutting-edge conversational AI, and grow with your team. Thank you for considering my application.

Ibrohim Abdivokhidov

We're eager to explore your creative and technical prowess. Please share any projects you've been a part of or created, such as websites, blog posts, web applications, or even a humorous cat meme page. We're particularly interested in submissions that showcase your ability to blend engaging copy with appealing design. *

I am a curious engineer who really enjoys building and shipping cool stuff. Last 1 year was incredible for me. I could work with a range of developers, engineers, financial managers who worked and are working in well-known companies. I could participate in a number of hackathons and am still participating and shipping.

I am the #1 who built the company from scratch using AI ChatGPT (https://gpthubai.vercel.app/). 

My most loved project and startup (https://medicord.vercel.app/). 

I write tutorials (https://abdibrokh1m.firebaseapp.com/) and articles (https://medium.com/me/stories/). 

We have created Report Cruncher, a cutting-edge financial analysis platform designed to simplify financial reports for retail investors. I could work with an Ex Software Engineer at eBay, and directors ( https://lablab.ai/event/openai-hackathon/ai-data-tools/report-cruncher). 

I have built WeShot, a new era of social media—a platform where moments are not just captured but cherished and shared in their most authentic form (https://github.com/abdibrokhim/weshot). 

I have built Truck ReportMe, an App that Automates Truck Reports in Logistics (https://github.com/abdibrokhim/monday.com-flutter-app-for-lgstcs). 

I have built a custom Truck Simulator, a classic game (https://github.com/abdibrokhim/TuckSimulator-unity) and video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9luZH0NjcR4).

I have built a Monday.com native Web application (VSCode clone), that allows to run queries instantly. Now, you don't need to open a Postman or Code editor to make queries to Monday.com API. (https://github.com/abdibrokhim/monday.com-ai-assistant-hackathon). 

I have built GenNFT, which allows users to seamlessly generate and mint custom NFTs (https://github.com/abdibrokhim/cw3d-AlchemySDK). 

I have built Lychee - Learn from YouTube videos like never before with AI Powered website (https://github.com/abdibrokhim/Lychee). 

I have built Glanz, our innovative mobile app, transforms online shopping into an interactive and personalized experience (https://vimeo.com/900519656). 

In the hackathon, We have created a no-code platform that caters to the 'customer care' department of the ecommerce websites, wherein the user can chat with our bot and the bot will figure out the problem/issue with the order and take action accordingly. I have worked with Amazon Internship engineers (https://lablab.ai/event/chatgpt-api-and-whisper-api-global-hackathon/clippy/no-code-customer-care-bot). 

And many more…

All my projects are open source: (https://github.com/abdibrokhim). 

In the context of GitStart's work environment, 'add, commit, push' represents my dedication to consistently contribute meaningful work ('add'), take full responsibility and ownership of my tasks ('commit'), and ensure my contributions drive the company forward by sharing and integrating my work ('push'). I am a resilient engineer and all above three words align perfectly with my proactive and collaborative approach to achieving the goals together.

Dear Jianna Liu,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is Ibrohim Abdivokhidov, and I am writing to express my keen interest in the Software Engineer Intern position at Leafpress. Having thoroughly reviewed the internship description, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to your mission of automating utility data collection and reporting for large real estate firms.

I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree (almost Senior student) in Software Engineering and have strong experience in Python programming and web scraping, which are essential skills for this role. My background includes developing efficient web scrapers and working independently to solve complex technical challenges. I am particularly drawn to Leafpress because of its innovative approach to using large language models in the fight against climate change and its impressive track record of success, including backing by Y Combinator and General Catalyst.

I am enthusiastic about the prospect of working directly with the founding team, including yourself (Jianna Liu) and Devi, and contributing to a company that is making a significant impact in climate-tech AI. I am also willing to relocate to San Francisco to fully immerse myself in this role and collaborate closely with the team full-time.
