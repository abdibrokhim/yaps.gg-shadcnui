This is my first time applying to YC.

### If you have already participated or committed to participate in an incubator, "accelerator" or "pre-accelerator" program, please tell us about it.
Not participated.

## Idea
### Why did you pick this idea to work on? Do you have domain expertise in this area? How do you know people need what you're making?
I have talked with my Professor for potential ideas to turn into products. So recently we have visited our government hospital in Tashkent. So there I found people are waiting in a big queue just to get the imaging results. So doctors are facing too much problem while giving the conclusion based on the results what they are getting based on the images. So this conclusion is taking a lot of time. So we plan like; why don't we build Al machine which analyze the results and it gives a conclusion automatically.

### Who are your competitors? What do you understand about your business that they don't?
The market for Brain MRI analysis software is rapidly growing. We face competition from several segments:
- Automated Brain MRI Analysis Systems: These include companies like Qure.ai, Цельс. They offer software that analyzes MRI scans for abnormalities and diagnoses various brain diseases.
- Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS) for Brain MRI: Companies like IBM Watson Health, GE Healthcare, Siemens Healthineers, Philips, and Fujifilm offer CDSS solutions that integrate AI with medical data to assist doctors in making diagnoses.
- Cloud-based Brain MRI Analysis Platforms: Google Cloud Healthcare, Amazon Web Services (AWS) for Healthcare, and Microsoft Azure for Healthcare provide cloud infrastructure for medical image analysis, including brain MRIs.
- Emerging Brain MRI Analysis Companies: Caption Health, Marley AI, Lumenore, Viz.ai, and Aidian are developing specialized AI tools for analyzing MRIs for specific conditions like stroke, dementia, and tumors.

In addition to these major competitors, Computer Vision (CV) also plays a significant role in this space. CV technologies are being used to develop automated MRI analysis systems that can compete with our platform.

They don't understand what is community and collaboration in healthcare industry. We envision a future where a supportive and interconnected healthcare community thrives, seamlessly connecting patients, medical professionals, and institutions to foster collaboration, knowledge sharing, and a patient-centric approach to healthcare.

### Where will most of your initial users be located?
UZ

### Which category best applies to your company?
Healthcare

### If you had any other ideas you considered applying with, please list them. One may be something we've been waiting for. Often when we fund people it's to do something they list here and not in the main application.
1. First, WeShot - a new horizon in social media. We offer a platform where users can capture life's spontaneous and spectacular moments, share them with a global community, and discover content that resonates with their personal tastes and interests. Our service solves the problem of superficial connections on traditional social media by fostering a community focused on genuine interactions and personalized experiences, fully powered by AI.

2. Second, Instant AI search on your laptop. We offer software that allows users to select the desired region/area of their screen and enter a prompt along with sending AI. Our solution reduces time and headache, no need to take a screenshot, open a website, upload a screenshot, then, get output. Just one click to launch software and you are good to go.

3. because AI hyped, we can introduce like funny typing speed web app no fails anymore, you type a letter and on mistaken a letter, it will regenerate the current word that continues the mistaken letter, until the word is the correct english word, otherwise it will be highlighted as a mistaken letter, and you may continue typing next word after space. our idea is to regenerate new unique word that continues mistaken letter
ex: current word: will => wi<mistaken letter=k> , so here you can see mistake happened, then, regenerate current word: will => wiki (because mistake was on letter l => k)
it will regenerate on each mistake new unique word

### Please describe the scientific basis for your product. How does it work?
Imagine a tool that can learn to "see" the subtle signs of disease within the intricate landscapes of the human brain. That's essentially what CoMedAI does. It harnesses the power of artificial intelligence, specifically a type of algorithm called a convolutional neural network (CNN), to analyze Brain MRI scans and assist doctors in making accurate diagnoses.
Think of it like training a super-powered detective. We feed the CNN a massive amount of data – in this case, numerous Brain MRI scans that have already been diagnosed by experts. Just like a detective learns to recognize patterns and clues, the CNN learns to identify features within these scans that correlate with different brain conditions, from tumors and strokes to developmental abnormalities and degenerative diseases.
Now, when a new, unseen scan is presented to CoMedAI, it acts like a seasoned detective at a crime scene. It meticulously examines the image, extracting key features and comparing them to the patterns it has learned. Based on this analysis, it generates a probability score for different brain conditions, essentially saying, "Based on what I've seen before, this scan is most likely indicative of X condition."
This information is then compiled into a comprehensive report for the doctor, including the AI's predictions and visual aids to highlight areas of interest. It's like providing the doctor with a detailed case file and expert consultation, all within a fraction of the time it would take for manual analysis.
The beauty of this approach lies in its ability to enhance diagnostic accuracy, improve efficiency, and ultimately lead to better patient care. By leveraging the power of AI, we're helping doctors "see" the brain in a new light, unlocking hidden clues and paving the way for earlier interventions and more effective treatments.

### If you were accepted into YC, what could you accomplish by Demo Day?
I hope I will be accepted into YC. Present CoMedAI at YC stage, and tell about future plans, next milestones.

### Does your product need regulatory approval (i.e., FDA)? If so, what is the approval process? What is your plan to get approved, and how much time and money will it take?
varied country to country

### What experimental data (if any) do you have showing that this would work?
I'm pretty sure it will work out. We have already talked with Hospitals about software we are working on. Especially in the villages where we may see lack of experienced radiologists. Our software will replace them, because it has higher accuracy and cost efficient. Hiring radiologist costs around $400 USD (based Uzbekistan), and our solution costs just $220,02 USD , it's x2 times less than salary of radiologist.

## Equity

### Have you formed ANY legal entity yet?
no

### If you have not formed the company yet, describe the planned equity ownership breakdown among the founders, employees and any other proposed stockholders. If there are multiple founders, be sure to give the proposed equity ownership of each founder and founder title (e.g. CEO). (This question is as much for you as us.)
I\'m not decided yet. I need some guidance from real successful startup founders at YC. However, when thinking about equity I don\'t think of it as a fixed pie, which is meant to be divided but rather as a tool that's going to increase our chances or your likelihood of being one of those few big financial successes. It's in our best interest to make sure that the early employees have a really strong sense of ownership of the company we\'re going to be working with them shoulder to shoulder for really long hours right and they're going to play a really large role in determining the outcome of our company.

### Have you taken any investment yet?
no

### Are you currently fundraising?
no

## Curious

### What convinced you to apply to Y Combinator? Did someone encourage you to apply? Have you been to any YC events?
The decision to apply to Y Combinator was driven by my own conviction and belief in the potential of our startup to make a significant impact in the healthcare technology space. Y Combinator's reputation for nurturing groundbreaking startups and its track record of supporting founders to bring innovative solutions to market resonated deeply with our mission. The opportunity to be part of a community that is at the forefront of technology and entrepreneurship, and to receive mentorship from some of the most successful entrepreneurs in the world, was incredibly compelling.

No single individual encouraged me to apply; rather, it was the realization that Y Combinator could provide the critical support, resources, and network needed to accelerate our growth and scale our impact. While I have not personally attended any YC events prior to applying, I have closely followed the journeys of YC alumni like; Sam Altman, Ben Horowitz, Steve Huffman, Emmett Shear, and have been inspired by the transformative innovations and the vibrant community that YC fosters. This deep admiration and the alignment of our goals with YC's ethos were the driving forces behind my decision to apply.

### How did you hear about Y Combinator?
Google search, YouTube, Inspired by Sam Altman, and many other Alumni.
