# Young Professional Internships Program 2025

American Councils for International Education (American Councils) is excited to offer the Young Professional Internships Program. This program provides 105 Uzbek undergraduate business and STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) majors with transformative internships at businesses in Uzbekistan. Through a robust program of professional development, participants will gain practical work experience and a greater understanding of international business practices as they prepare to enter the competitive 21st century workforce.
The Young Professional Internships Program provides business mentors and dedicated staff as a built-in support system intended to maximize the internship experience and provide a meaningful, positive experience for interns.
The Young Professional Internships Program provides the opportunity for interns to work within a cohort, participate in professional development events, engage with industry leaders, and enter a valuable network of peers. The Young Professional Internships Program is designed to: expand the professional capacity and network of young Uzbeks in the areas of business and STEM; and empower participants with the tools needed to become self-reliant learners.
Participants will be selected through a merit-based, open competition aimed at identifying future business and STEM leaders prepared to gain real-world experience in their field and in a cross-cultural environment prior to begin their careers.
A selection committee determines the semifinalists, and American Councils matches them with suitable host companies in Uzbekistan. Each semifinalist interviews with two potential host companies before a final placement is determined. Once a candidate is placed with a host company, they officially become a program finalist and are eligible to participate in the program.
American Councils provides dedicated internship placement to fit the interests and goals of interns. Interns will receive a small stipend to support their travel and living costs.

Hi, there!
I\'m Ibrohim Abdivokhidov. Or you can call me Abee for short.
I\'m the founder CEO at Open Community. We build Open Source AI-powered projects and tools for people. We also write comprehensive and step-by-step tutorials on those projects and share across socials like LinkedIn, Medium, Dev, and our friendly community on Discord. So anyone, whether he or she is a beginner, a professional developer, or just a tech enthusiast, has a chance to learn how to build real-world stuff with AI.
There are a number of reasons why I\'m considering applying for the YPIP. One of the main reasons is to gain professional work experience, understand international business on a global scale, and be fully prepared to shape the world. As you know, we are still in the 21st century, and everything is becoming highly competitive in every aspect of life. In particular, the tech industry—including AI, AGI, and ASI—is already heavily shaping the world.
I\'m 21, from Uzbekistan. I have a passion for building stuff and helping others do the same. I am very active on various platforms: I share tutorials on Medium, Dev, and GitHub; create videos on YouTube; engage and collaborate with diverse individuals on Discord and X; and share my journey while supporting others on LinkedIn.
One of the achievements I am most proud of is mentoring over 200,000 developers, including youth from different countries and diverse backgrounds. 
Being a part of the YPIP\'s family would provide me with the opportunity to participate in professional development meetings and engage with industry leaders, join a valuable network of peers and become self-reliant learner.
I authored a paper on machine learning, which was published by Springer and indexed by Scopus at ICSDI 2024. Then, I received an offer from Souk, an Algerian e-commerce startup, where I worked as a mobile developer. I also served as an AI research intern at Dugree, where my team conducted research on over 30 papers, primarily focusing on “Human-AI Collaboration for the Toughest Political Discussions.” Recently, I presented my paper, “Enhancing Trade and Investment Patterns in Central Asia Using AI,” at the DKU 2024 conference. I am an open-source contributor at Anarchy Labs (over 500 stars on GitHub) and Langflow (over 35K stars on GitHub).
I am still trying to figure out what I live for, what I truly want, and how I want to look back on my life when it's time to go. Creativity requires faith, and faith necessitates relinquishing control. However, sharing knowledge is my passion, and I believe education is the most powerful tool for change. By inspiring and guiding people, I believe we can build an innovative and compassionate society.
In the short term, I plan to deepen my knowledge in AI for bioinformatics. After working on CoMed (my startup), I found that Neuroscience would be an excellent field for me to continue my education.
In the long term, I plan to teach undergraduate computer science students after earning my Ph.D. from a university.
