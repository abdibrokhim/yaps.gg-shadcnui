## Give us an example of an initiative you led at this organization or project that resulted in positive change. [200 words]
During my time at Dugree, I led an initiative aimed at enhancing our platform's ability to facilitate engaging and constructive conversations on difficult topics. I conducted comprehensive research on cutting-edge papers, including **SOTOPIA-π**, **CLOVA**, **Automatic Prompt Selection for Large Language Models**, and **ExpertPrompting**. My role involved not only understanding these complex studies but also translating their findings into practical applications within our startup. I organized and conducted live lectures for our community, breaking down the research into actionable insights and facilitating discussions to explore their potential.

By applying the concepts from these papers—such as interactive learning for socially intelligent language agents and closed-loop visual assistance with tool usage—we identified new opportunities to improve user engagement and conversation quality on our platform. For example, integrating strategies from **Automatic Prompt Selection** and **ExpertPrompting** helped us develop more targeted and context-aware dialogue prompts, enhancing the relevance and depth of conversations.

This initiative resulted in noticeable improvements in user learning and engagement, demonstrating the real-world applicability of academic research. Moreover, the initiative led to the generation of new ideas for future research, aligning with Dugree's mission to foster open, unbiased dialogue. This experience not only advanced our platform's capabilities but also strengthened our community's commitment to evidence-based practices.

## Give us an example of an initiative you led at this organization or project that resulted in positive change. [200 words]
Since the launch of Open Community, I have led several successful initiatives, particularly in hackathons, that have brought positive change and growth to our platform. For example, during the AI Mental Health Hackathon, we won third place with our project MeWellAI, an AI-powered mobile app for mental wellness. This app functions like a social media platform, featuring specialized agents for specific mental health issues, offering users tailored support and resources.

Another significant initiative was our work on Langflow AI. We aimed to automate the Langflow platform using AI, moving beyond the traditional drag-and-drop interface to a voice-command-based system. While we did not win this hackathon, we had the invaluable opportunity to collaborate live via Discord with the CTO of Langflow and their Senior Frontend Developer, gaining insights and feedback that enhanced our project. Our efforts received enthusiastic comments from industry professionals on LinkedIn, including praise from the CTO and CEO of Langflow.

Additionally, we developed Monkeytype AI, a minimalistic, customizable AI-powered typing test. It offers seamless typing experiences, real-time feedback, auto word correction, and AI-generated themes. Within just one week, this project garnered interest from over 100 users.

These initiatives have significantly impacted our community, fostering innovation, collaboration, and skill development.

These experiences made me realize the importance of having a supportive community. I wanted to build a platform where tech enthusiasts could overcome self-doubt and confidently explore new opportunities, regardless of the outcome. My goal is to foster collaboration among individuals from diverse backgrounds and nationalities, helping them grow their skills, expand their networks, and become future leaders. By encouraging members to tackle small projects that address specific issues, we can gradually create positive change and innovation, starting from the ground up. This initiative aims to empower others, reduce isolation in the learning process, and build a strong, collaborative community that supports each member's growth and success.

I am driven by curiosity and a desire to explore innovative solutions, often thinking outside the box and encouraging others to take risks and try new approaches, even if the outcome is uncertain. 

For example, I led the development of **MeWellAI**, an AI-powered mental wellness app, from ideation to execution within a very short timeframe. This experience showcased my ability to generate creative ideas and see them through to completion, even under pressure. My approach involves fostering a supportive environment where every team member feels valued and empowered to contribute their unique perspectives and skills. 

I believe that understanding and empathy are crucial in leadership. Over the past few years, I've worked with diverse teams across different cultures and backgrounds, which has enhanced my ability to listen actively and understand different viewpoints. My leadership style is about encouraging collaboration, embracing challenges, and nurturing growth—both individually and as a community, always striving to inspire and uplift those I work with.

## Written Vision Statement (400 words)

Please provide a written statement covering the following aspects: Community Impact: 

### How do you envision using the knowledge and experience gained from this fellowship to positively impact your community either through ongoing paid or volunteer engagement or a new initiative that you wish to undertake?

I envision the future where a collaborative and inclusive approach will solve the environmental challenges. I plan to start a multi-faith climate action network in Uzbekistan. We all unite in diverse religious communities to address the pressing issue of climate change. It gives us an opportunity to encourage education, advocacy, and community-driven environmental projects.

I have solid experience in building supportive and fun communities. One of my strong skills is to organize and mobilize diverse groups towards common goals. Let’s take Open Community as an example. I found it to foster collaboration between 150+ tech builders, designers, storytellers, and creators from different countries and nationalities including India, Uzbekistan, USA. In Open Community we build potential startups within SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals) including waste reduction, water conservation, and reforestation efforts, all framed within the context of religious teachings on the care of creation. Weekly live sessions make us like we are one big family.

I have hands-on experience in AI (Artificial Intelligence) and its technologies including Prompt Engineering and building Agentic workflows. Participating in the Youth Interfaith Leaders Fellowship opens big doors for me. Meeting in person with climate-conscious young leaders from around the world helps me to generate new ideas. I believe I will gain promising new skills to apply the value-based framework rooted in faith to effectively address climate change using AI.

Beyond the fellowship, I will maintain and expand this interfaith climate action network. I will continue to engage with the fellowship alumni. In Faith For Our Planet network we will share best practices and collaborate on international climate initiatives. I will also amplify the voices of underrepresented communities in global climate discussions. It’s important that their perspectives are heard on the world stage.

As a long-term goal, I will establish a formal organization supporting interfaith climate action in Central Asia. It will provide ongoing education, resources, and support for faith-based environmental initiatives. It's a kind of central hub to promote sustainable practices and foster collaboration across religious communities in the region.
