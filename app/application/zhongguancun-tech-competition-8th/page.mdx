# 8th Zhongguancun Tech Competition: Overseas Application

### Project Name:
Paper AI

### Project Description (No more than 500 words):
Paper AI - the ultimate Open-source AI-powered research companion that streamlines literature reviews, enhances real-time collaboration, and offers a smart voice assistant to revolutionize your research experience.

Paper AI is an innovative web application that transforms academic research by integrating artificial intelligence, collaborative tools, and an AI voice assistant similar to Apple's Siri. Users can upload research papers and interact with them by annotating, highlighting, and adding personal notes. When text is highlighted, the integrated AI—powered by OpenAI's latest o1 language models and the AI/ML API - instantly provides explanations and summaries, enhancing comprehension of complex concepts.

A standout feature is the AI Voice Assistant, powered by ElevenLabs, which allows users to interact with the platform using voice commands. For example, a user can click the assistant button and say, "Hey, any updates from my co-researcher Wei Tang?" This feature streamlines communication and keeps researchers informed in real-time, making the research process more efficient and engaging.

The tool reaches learners—including researchers, students, and academics—by being globally accessible online with multilingual support. It addresses challenges like information overload and time-consuming literature reviews, improving learning outcomes such as increased comprehension and reduced research time. By fostering a shared learning ecosystem, it encourages collaboration across disciplines and geographic boundaries.

Technologically, Paper AI is built with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS, and deployed on Vercel for optimal performance. It utilizes the open-source Adobe PDF Embed API as the core of the platform, allowing seamless interaction with PDF documents. The AI functionalities are powered by OpenAI's latest o1 language models and the AI/ML API, providing advanced natural language processing capabilities.

The AI Voice Assistant leverages ElevenLabs' technology for realistic and contextually aware speech synthesis across multiple languages. For data storage and synchronization, the platform uses Google's Cloud Services—including Firebase Auth, Firebase Realtime Database, and Storage—ensuring scalability and reliability. User authentication and management are handled by Clerk, offering comprehensive embeddable UIs and APIs for a seamless user experience.

To enhance performance on the client side, Paper AI employs IndexedDB for storing audio results from the AI Voice Assistant, ensuring that user data is not collected and maintaining data security. This allows for high-performance searches and efficient data retrieval without compromising user privacy.

I've been in IT for 5 years. I\'ve 4+ years of research experience. I\'ve 2+ years of hands-on experience in different fields including web/mobile app and software development, UI/UX design, and AI model training & tuning. I usually code in Python, Typescript/Javascript, Dart and have intermediate knowledge in Java,  C/C++, R, Swift, GraphQL, PostgreSQL, Rust. I use frameworks such as Flutter, React, Django, Flask, FastAPI, Next.js, Tauri, PyTorch, and TensorFlow. I prefer the following tools: Redux, Postman, Jira, Git, Colab, Firebase, Docker, Tailwind CSS, and ChatGPT. I would love to use all my skills to make something people want. I believe soft skills play a crucial role in team formation. As a leader I\'m resilient who felt enough of the dose of pain and suffering. Listening to others ideas and opinions will definitely move towards success. I\'m really good at Prompt Engineering. Over the last two years I closely collaborated with different AI tools.

Hi there! I major in law with a strong interest in tech and business. In the past year, I had the opportunity to work with an overseas company to support startups with their corporate documents and also help build the in-house legal tech tool. During my second-year summer break, I was lucky to have completed the 42 Kuala Lumpur one-month coding selection programme and was offered to join as their cadet. With AI models evolve and become ever-intelligent, I observe and visualise its use cases in providing betterment and enhancing the productivity, accessibility and connectivity in many aspects of our human lives from the infant to the elderly and the sustainability of humanity. Paper AI and CoMed are some of the examples of use cases that people should really try using the applications to see their potential. Being a law student myself, sometimes we will have to deal with and read long legal article filled with heavy content from legal principles to contentious points, with this hassle, Paper AI though focuses on research papers comes in handy as it allows real-time collaboration and advanced ask and search features. CoMed on the other hand shortens the time to analyse the diagnosis report by feeding in the model with precedent pictures. In essence, we can the potential of AI in contributing to a happier live and human\'s longevity and I believe and will continue to support and contribute to the ethical use of AI and tech innovation to make our existing world as sustainable as possible and ensure a peaceful and lovely world to the new generations.

### Project Name:
CoMed

### Project Description (No more than 500 words):
CoMed is an AI platform transforming Brain MRI diagnostics to be easier, faster, and more accessible, especially in underserved rural areas. By integrating advanced AI into hospital workflows, we boost diagnostic accuracy from 84% to 95% and reduce waiting times from days to 15–30 minutes. Targeting hospitals and clinics lacking advanced diagnostics and radiologists, we aim to bridge critical healthcare gaps.

We provide affordable AI tools at $220 per month, enhancing accuracy, & reducing wait times. Our long-term goal is to make advanced diagnostics universally accessible, fostering a global healthcare ecosystem that empowers medical professionals and patients alike.

We've developed a functional prototype, secured contracts with over 1,400 hospitals, accessed 3 million medical records for AI training. Received support from Amazon ($10,000), Microsoft ($150,000), and OpenAI ($2,500).
